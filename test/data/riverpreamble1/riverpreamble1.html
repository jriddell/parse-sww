			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allt Coire Laire lies some 20 miles north-east of Fort William. It is a tributary of the Spean, joining the main river about 1km above Inverlair Falls, the take-out for the upper run. This little-known classic is best saved for when one of those Big Water days that we all pine for actually arrives. If you’ve just had a blast on the Upper Spean with all 6 pipes open and a whole lot more, you’ll want to start thinking about getting off the Spean at about where the Allt Coire Laire flows in, well before the scary lead-in to Inverlair Falls. The run starts off fairly flat, braided, and gravelly, in a steep sided, forested glen, but quickly picks up until one twisting bedrock and bouldery rapid links with another. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A small dam at the top of the run means that it needs to have been very wet (torrential rain, or heaps of snow melt plus lots of rain). The run-off is pretty quick, due to the steep sides and shallow soil of <span xml:lang="en-US">the</span> catchment. Where the road crosses the burn (or from the confluence if you’re on the Spean), if it looks pretty ‘scrapey’, with lots of rocks showing through – don’t do it. If, however, the water under the bridge looks as if it can’t wait to join the Spean and go nuts at Inverlair – have a couple of Mars bars and get that boat on your shoulder. Completely ignore any murmurs of ‘I can’t be arsed walking, man’. It’s not very far... honest!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">Continue beyond the take-out for the Upper Spean</span> for <span xml:lang="en-US">another</span> mile. Once out of the forest, the road goes over the Laire. This bridge, or the confluence with the Spean, is the take-out. To get to the put-in, backtrack to the first house beside the road on the right. Park here and walk for about 2km up the private track to the left. You are in forest all the way, with the odd view down through the trees to the river. When the track goes back down to the river, there is a quarry and a dam – put in here.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">After the initial boulder section, where the main challenge is to pick the deepest channel between endless rocks, the Laire becomes quite con<span xml:lang="en-US">tinuous</span>. Running through a mini bedrock gorge<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> it<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s steep and tight for a while with lots of twisting chutes, boulder splats, and all that is fun in a short boat. The more water, the more fun! Keep eddy-hopping and look out for trees. There are no portages, but strainers may be a problem and there are definitely a few things worth looking at if you’re unsure. All too soon, the river opens out again and g<span xml:lang="en-US">ains</span> a bit more volume for the last <span xml:lang="en-US">500</span>m – float down this reminiscing and giggling until you reach the bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>This trip is perfect in combination with the Upper Spean and the Treig. It</span><span xml:lang="en-US">’</span><span>s best for a small group, since the river is narrow and the eddies tiny.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-1"><a id="Anchor-54" />Spean</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Spean is one of the larger rivers on the west that is easily accessible for the kayaker. It<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s never too far from the A86 Spean Bridge to Kingussie road. Glen Spean is a broad open glen that has the mountains of Ben Nevis to the south and Creag Meagaidh (craig meggy) to the north. The views from the upper stretches<br />of the river remind you why you come to the outdoors. The river has four distinct sections<span xml:lang="en-US"> plus the ‘unrunnable’ Monessie Gorge</span>. On <span xml:lang="en-US">six</span> pipes, the upper section offers the biggest volume white<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>water run in the UK. At more reasonable releases, it is still a great fun and continuous run. The Monessie section has an adventurous feel before you even get on the river. Its combination of gorges and long<br />rapids leave the kayaker begging for more. Open water from here gives good boating on the middle section at an easier level. The Spean Gorge is a classic trip, which can be run at low flows. <span xml:lang="en-US">This is a </span>technical run, away from roads for much of its length. The river has been tamed by Laggan Dam. It now only provides entertainment for the big water junkie when Lochaber district is in one of its wetter moods. However, with the Roy as its major tributary, the middle and gorge runs often have good volumes of water. The river has not yet, to our knowledge, been run in its entirety from the dam to Mucomir Power Station in one push, without portages<span xml:lang="en-US">;</span> maybe something for the next generation of kayakers?</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Upper Spean starts at Laggan Dam (<span xml:lang="en-US">NN </span>372 807), <span xml:lang="en-US">9</span> miles east of Spean Bridge on the A86. It follows this road at a discreet distance until it is crossed by the minor road to Fersit. The Upper Spean is probably the largest volume white<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>water run in Scotland. When all <span xml:lang="en-US">six</span> pipes are blowing and there is a large flow coming over the top of the dam, this is the closest thing that you will get to monsoon boating in the Himalaya. Getting in just below the dam is a belittling experience as the amount of water cascading out of the air is phenomenal. The open nature of this run gives excellent boating with continuous white water for the first 2km.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There is no point in coming to the Upper Spean if the Laggan Dam isn’t full. During the summer, a sudden downpour will make no difference to this section of river. During the latter half of the winter and in the spring when the heavens open, the dam will fill and suddenly you will find that the pipes are on. <span xml:lang="en-US">Two</span> pipes gives an interesting run at grade 3+. <span xml:lang="en-US">Four</span> pipes gives an Alpine-like grade 4 run. <span xml:lang="en-US">Six</span> pipes gives monsoon like conditions (full-on grade 4!). No pipes mean no run and no fun. The best gauge is the Laggan Dam. However if you are approaching from Fort William or Inverness then a look over the bridge at Spean Bridge will give an indication as to the amount of water. There is a gauge on the downstream left side of the bridge. Above 4 on the gauge and you may be in luck. Remember that the Roy is a major tributary upstream of here and may account for most or all of the water you see. The SEPA gauge is <span xml:lang="en-US">further downstream </span>on the River Lochy, so again, it may not tell you if the dam is releasing.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Park <span xml:lang="en-US">in the large lay-by beside</span> the A86 <span xml:lang="en-US">next to</span> the dam. Walk down the road for 100m, cross a fence and continue down a steep bracken covered slope. Egress is just above Inverlair Falls on the Fersit road, accessed from the A86 approximately 2½ miles downstream of the dam. There is ample parking on the right after the small bridge that spans<span xml:lang="en-US"> the</span> Inverlair Gorge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The run changes hugely in character depending on the flow. Good for intermediate paddlers on one pipe, it is a total blast on all six! There is a large boulder that produces the infamous pour-over ledge in the middle of the river<br />about 150m downstream of the dam. Once past this the river is fast and continuous for the next 2km, and in the biggest flows moves like grease lightening – swimming here is bad. At this level the trees, usually on the banks, are in the water and escape is going to be hazardous. Generally there are few holes to avoid so relax and enjoy it. Once at the railway bridge the river eases to give you a break. There is one more grade 3+ rapid that can be boat scouted before the gorge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The next time the banks close in signifies the lower gorge, which is best inspected from the left bank. It is at its most technical on two pipes when the entry hole is followed by a large whirlpool that can swallow smaller boats. Don’t let this put the playboaters off; this spot can give lots of fun if you have a nose clip and a bomber roll! Take out at the end of the gorge, river right, under the road bridge, or at moderate flows, paddle the<br />rapid below right of the central rock, then ferry<br />across to take out on river left. Just below<br />here lies Inverlair Falls (Gd 5+). They have been kayaked on the left, but to swim this monster fall is a one-way ticket out of here. There are stories of people being rescued on the lip of the drop and even an epic tale of a paddler being plucked by helicopter from the island that splits the falls. Don’t let this be you. On six pipes, it’s best not to attempt the lower gorge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If you think that a swim in the lower gorge is a possibility then get out and walk the last 150m to the bridge. If you end up swimming in the last gorge then our advice is dump everything and swim for shore as if your life depends on it<span xml:lang="en-US"> </span>... it does!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Monessie Gorge is a hideous cataract blocked by sumps, huge holes and guarded by a large waterfall. <span xml:lang="en-US">It </span>has been scraped down at low flows but would be very serious with the dam releasing. The section described begins immediately below this monster! The Spean has just spent its energy forcing its way through a tortuous gorge and is trying to relax. There are however a few last surprises before Roy Bridge. This is a varied piece of white water, with all the right ingredients. The combination of gorges, flat pools and long open rapids makes for an interesting trip.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To make the most of this run you need at least <span xml:lang="en-US">two</span> pipes releasing from Laggan Dam. However,<br /><span xml:lang="en-US">six</span> pipes may be too much for the uniniti-<br />ated as the grade 5 comes up all of a sudden. As for the Upper Spean, the best gauge is the dam. Looking over the bridge at Spean Bridge may give a false indication about this run, as much of the water here may be coming down the Roy, which joins the Spean below the<br />Monessie section.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Drive upstream from Roy Bridge for 1½ miles to a small turn-off into the woods on the left by a gate. It is possible to drop people off here, but parking is limited to two cars. If you see the river on your right, then you have gone too far. Access is over the road and down the field until you come to the railway line. You can now drop into the small stream bed on your right and pass under the railway via the ‘Tunnel of Fear’. The stupid will trespass on the railway and down climb the muddy bank. Egress is at Roy Bridge where you can get out at the caravan and chalet park, carrying your boats to the village. It is however a long carry to any decent parking, so why not continue on down the middle section to Spean Bridge?</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Emerging from the tunnel under the railway, intrepid paddlers will find themselves at a small pool with a strong jet of water crashing out of the Monessie Gorge and into a cliff. Across this is your warm-up playwave. Out of this pool and you are straight into the first gorge (Gd 3). There are no ‘must make’ lines and a short stretch of easier water is enough for the collection of any debris. Next, the river<br />throws in a long grade 3 rapid and then a shorter stretch of flat water before it rounds a left corner and over Split Decision, a severe grade 5. Get out to inspect on the right at the top of the bank defences. Lines down the left or right are possible at different water levels; it’s your choice. <span xml:lang="en-US">P</span>ut<span xml:lang="en-US">ting </span>in directly below Split Decision is tricky, but worth the effort as you’re straight into the second gorge, which offers fast and furious grade 3+ water. From here down to Roy Bridge, the river is open and relatively flat. A close watch on the bank as you near Roy Bridge is necessary to spot the small sandy beach that marks the egress.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The egress point at Roy Bridge is a private caravan park and not a car park. Please respect the local populace and carry back up to the main road (¾km) and a public car park. It is definitely easiest just to carry on down the Middle Spean to Spean Bridge. This will be a <span xml:lang="en-US">30 minute</span> blast if the river is high.  </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The large 8m entry fall to Monessie Gorge itself is sometimes paddled; you would want one or possibly two pipes releasing. We would highly recommend climbing out river right with the aid of a rope. <span xml:lang="en-US"> Downstream from here, things start to look a lot more unpleasant.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Wide and open, with a mix of bedrock and boulder rapids, the trip from Roy Bridge to Spean Bridge is more straightforward than the other sections of the Spean. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This section can be paddled at almost any level. At lesser flows, it provides entertainment for beginners. Between 1 and 4 on the gauge in Spean Bridge, river left, downstream of the bridge, is a good level. Below this, it can be run, but is a bit of a scrape. In flood, the section becomes fast and continuous, with some good play potential. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">T<span xml:lang="en-US">o reach the put-in, t</span>urn off the A86 in Roy Bridge beside the Roy Bridge Hotel and Grey Corries Lodge. After the road passes beneath the railway bridge it bends to the left. Here there is a stile, and a path to the river. As there is little space on this road it’s better to move vehicles to the public car park in Roy Bridge and walk the short distance to the river. <span xml:lang="en-US">Take out</span> on river left <span xml:lang="en-US">and walk up </span>to the car park in Spean Bridge behind the woollen mill.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Having spent its energy in the upper sections the Spean is now content to relax<span xml:lang="en-US">, w</span>ith straightforward water until it reaches Railway Bridge Falls (Gd 3+) which lie down-st<span xml:lang="en-US">r</span>eam of the bridge, towards the end of the run. Here, depending on the water level, you’ll find either a straightforward 1<span xml:lang="en-US">.5</span>m ledge or a more powerful hole. The best line is not obvious from above and there are some places you would not want to be. At medium and low levels, it’s possible to inspect from the slippery rocks on river right on the lip of the drop, but you are now committed to the right-hand side; at higher flows you will need to get out before the start of the long lead-in rapids, river left. The excitement over, the end soon comes, and people may want to continue on through the gorge or take advantage of the shop, restaurant, pub and toilets here in Spean Bridge. Take out river left, at the top of the rapid which runs under the road bridge.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Middle Spean can be combined with several other runs to create longer trips that cater for the wide range of skills within a group. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The section starts as a wide and shingle-braided<br />river, with a few small bedrock features. At flows above 3 on the gauge in Spean, a good play wave forms beside a huge bolder on river<br />right. Paddle on past the stanchions of the old railway bridge. Your first glimpse of the ruins of General Wade’s High Bridge marks the approach to Fairy Steps (Gd 3+), a series of small twisting drops. You are now entering the gorge. At medium and low flows, there is one notable rapid with a fun pop-out spot, and a number of smaller chutes before the river narrows at Head Banger (Gd 5). Take care to make an eddy on river left in good time to inspect/protect/portage as necessary</span><span xml:lang="en-US">.</span><span> In recent years the siphon appears to have worsened</span><span xml:lang="en-US">;</span><span> at low flows this is a definite danger. At high flows, it becomes more straightforward, and eventually washes out leaving </span><span xml:lang="en-US">two </span><span>crashing diagonal waves. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Below Head Banger lies the most continuous section. It starts with a narrow gap that feeds you into a small boily area with a leaning wall on the left. There is a small eddy just below this, which holds only one or two boats. The next rapid, The Cave, is no more frightening than the last and gives fewer problems. You have almost escaped the clutches of the gorge now and only have to negotiate the famous Constriction, where at low water the river squeezes<br />through a gap that becomes narrower than your boat. At medium levels, above 1 on the gauge, this chute can be avoided by going over the Gallery Window to the right, although this too becomes feisty in higher water. At higher flows again, water covers the whole feature, the line opens and water races across the pool below and into the cliff beyond. There are only two more rapids left now. The first is obvious (Gd 3+)<span xml:lang="en-US"> –</span> just avoid the large cushion wave on the right. The second has several choices, but watch out for trees. You are now leaving the gorge and there is only the long flat paddle out and fond memories of rapids run to amuse the tired paddler.</p>
