			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Flowing from the outskirts of Livingston through Almondell and Calderwood Country Park, this is a surprisingly decent, intermediate grade run which flows relatively frequently.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Generally wet weather is required; if the ground is wet then it doesn’t need much rain to get it into condition. Above 0.8 on the Almond (Lothian)@Almondell SEPA Gauge is a runnable level.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Put in at Almondell and Calderwood Country Park Mid Calder car park on the Linhouse just above its confluence with the Almond. A footbridge crosses the Linhouse Water at this point and makes an easy access point. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Egress can be made either at Lins Mill Aqueduct, which requires a steep and slippery climb back up to the Union Canal on the left bank, or by paddling 2km further downstream to the stone bridge in Newbridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Putting in above the confluence with the Linhouse Water leads straight into a wide section of river above a low vertical weir. This can be run hard left at lower levels (shallow) but forms a nasty hole when higher, portage right. Below this the river narrows with wooded banks before the canal feeder weir is reached – a rough shallow slide. A couple of nice grade 2 rapids follow flowing beneath an old railway viaduct before the SEPA gauging weir is reached, marked by the hut on the right bank and cable across the river. This can be a bit<br />retentive at high flows but makes a nice playspot at lower levels. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">The river steepens on the approach to the next bridge with a series of ledges and chutes both upstream and downstream. A small suspension bridge marks the start of a nice long section of grade 2/3 with a mixture of shingle rapids and boulder gardens. After approximately 3km the Lins Mill Aqueduct </span><span xml:lang="en-US">and the Union Canal come into view and the final grade 3 section begins. Here the river bed becomes bedrock and the gradient steepens, forming a series of wide playwaves at most levels, getting bigger and steeper below the aqueduct. At higher flows, the holes become big and retentive with the section culminating in a pushy river-wide ledge approximately 2m in height (Gd 4). Egress can be made here by walking up the left bank and climbing up to the canal or continue below the M8 down to Newbridge.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">The </span><span xml:lang="en-US">Almond collects the treated outfalls from several sewage treatment works and is rated poor water quality by SEPA, so it’s probably worth trying not to drink too much water,<br />especially immediately after heavy rain.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There’s a short section of grade 4 on the<br />Almond at Cammo just upstream of Cramond Brig. A narrow bedrock fall, it runs even at quite low levels. Downstream, between Cramond Brig and the Firth of Forth are two large weirs. The first is rocky and shallow with no clean line. The second, marked by a ruined mill on the river right, is a vertical fall of 2m with a slight horseshoe shape creating a nasty hole at most flows.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The <span class="Pesda-Bold--Emphasis-">Linhouse Water</span> has been run (Gd 4) from the A71 culvert (NT 074 660; 55.8786, -3.4801) down into the Almond. This is a tight and technical run of small falls and slides through a lovely wooded glen. The tunnel at the put-in can be run but the dog leg makes it dark and sketchy with protection recommended at the ledge two-thirds of the way through. Take care for fallen trees. It needs the Almondell SEPA gauge to be 1.2 or above.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-1"><a id="Anchor-10" />North Esk </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US"><a id="x.21452" />Rising in the Pentland Hills above Penicuik,<br />the North Esk has nearly 25km of paddling all within a stone’s throw of Edinburgh.<br />Roslin</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> Glen, the middle section, is a particular highlight as the river flows through a stunning sandstone gorge alive with wildlife and steeped in history. Sections above become an option at higher flows. Of moderate grade throughout, with a couple of harder falls and weirs and several surf waves, for those in the Lothians this makes a great after-work run or quick blast for those short of time.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><a id="x.21455" />The upper section runs from Penicuik to Roslin.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Esk (Lothian)@Musselburgh SEPA gauge: 0.6-1.0 is low; 1.0-1.5 is medium; above 1.5 is high.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Access is normally straightforward and without issue though be aware of people’s gardens and private land when paddling through the several small towns. Some of the roads to the access points are extremely steep and narrow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Starting downstream of the A701 bridge in<br />Penicuik fast water leads to what is probably the hardest rapid on the whole river (Gd 4). An old railway bridge signals the approach: watch out for tree blockages in the bridge arches. Climb out river right above the bridge to inspect<br />as gabion baskets line the bank downstream making an exit very difficult above the falls. Bedrock slabs with big holes in high water lead to a river-wide ledge; river right normally provides the best line.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Downstream, low-hanging trees and fast shallow water lead to the bridge at Auchendinny, where alternative access can be made. A long sloping concrete weir is run in the middle before a nice long section of grade 3 boulder gardens continues past the new housing development at Dalmore. Continue beneath the old arched viaduct to the recently collapsed gunpowder mill weir. This can be paddled through the new channel on the right, or portaged on the left through the ruins. Fast water with a couple of playwaves continue to the road bridge at the start of the mid-section at Roslin.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">From the put-in at Roslin, the river sweeps round a right-hand bend on the approach to the gorge. A grade 3 rapid leads to a narrow slot which can be tricky and needs inspecting for wood. Below the slot you enter Roslin Glen, a deep, dark, incredibly scenic sandstone gorge. Keep an eye open for wildlife and for the castles and ruined bridges high up on the lip of the gorge. Fun, straightforward rapids continue<br />with several undercut cliffs to watch out for. At higher flows, a nice wave forms directly beneath a waterfall coming of</span><span xml:lang="en-US">f the right wall. Once past a huge rock face on river left the bedrock walls recede, replaced by steep wooded banks. Landslides are common here and can change the nature of the river dumping wood and debris in the main channel. A steeper<br />section with overhanging trees leads to another<br />large concrete weir near Springfield. This weir started to collapse in early 2018 and will<br />undoubtedly change further. It is currently<br />unrunnable, with the main flow running through a ragged breach on river right. Portage on the left. This is followed by a short fast section before the road bridge at Polton is reached. Access/egress river left, downstream of the bridge.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Despite its moderate grading, this is not a run for beginners, due to the numerous dangers such as low trees, wood, undercuts and weirs. The car park at Roslin glen closes after sunset. SEPA rated the river quality as poor; try not to drink it.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The lower section runs from Polton to Dalkeith and thence to Musselburgh. The weir downstream of the put-in should be inspected carefully. The river left side has recently (2018) completely collapsed allowing a clear route but it may collect wood. Big bouncy water leads beneath an old railway viaduct to Lasswade, which is an alternative access/egress. Downstream, easy and scenic paddling leads through the grounds of several country houses. A large weir, immediately downstream of a single span arch, should be inspected. From here it is a straightforward run though to Dalkeith where egress can be made at Ironmills Park.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The scenery gets grander on the final 8km to Musselburgh, which takes you into Dalkeith Country Park and the tax haven owned Buccleuch Estates. There is a vertical weir after the impressive Montagu Bridge: take out before the bridge to portage on the right. Grade 2 rapids take you through to the Meeting of the Waters with the South Esk where the river gets wider. A 45° weir as you enter Musselburgh can be slid down in the centre to finish your journey.</p>
