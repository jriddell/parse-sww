			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Not one to be missed<span xml:lang="en-US">, t</span>his is a short run with plenty of rapids to keep you entertained. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This burn needs recent rain to get going, but will come up quickly. At the take-out bridge, the water needs to be covering most of the river bed, but does not need a significant flow. If the water here is high, the lower gorge will be hard, particularly for a first run down. The Holy Linn section will be cracking and inspection is easy on the way in.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To get to the top put-in at Holy Linn from St John’s Town of Dalry, follow the A702 for a little under 2 miles. Look for the core path signs marked Holy Linn Waterfall (NX 650 812; 55.1070, -4.1171)<span xml:lang="en-US">.</span> The lay-by will take <span xml:lang="en-US">two</span> cars<span xml:lang="en-US">. There</span><span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s more space up the road, if needed, at the next core path sign. From the lay-by, follow the core path through two fields using the tallest of the trees rising from the wood ahead of you to guide you towards the fall. You<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>ll get to a gate after about 600m. From here there<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s one rapid downstream worth inspecting. The rest can be seen as you head back upstream to the fall. Take out where the A713 road bridge crosses the burn, around 2 miles south of St John’s Town of Dalry.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>Holy Linn is generally shot river right, although a line opens up on the far left in higher flows. The centre line has a siphon and is best avoided.<br />The fall is easily lapped and is well worth the energy on this short run. Four ledge drops<br />follow in quick succession and are also worth a second go if you enjoyed them first time round. The next 1.5km is relatively straightforward and gives continuous white water. The small fall at Grennan Mill can be inspected from river right. The Holme’s Gorge section starts immediately after the Grennan Mill Bridge and inspection of the whole section, about 450m, is worthwhile from the left bank. This is a steep tight section of white water that is hard to read and run. The grade 4 tag for this run is well</span><span xml:lang="en-US">-</span><span>deserved: expect the grade to go up if the river is high.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Holme’s Gorge will be enjoyable for those who liked the Holy Linn section and didn’t feel stretched. To others it may feel like an ordeal, despite its short length. The gorge can be portaged left along to the second set of steps.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A short section and a bit of a two-hit wonder, the entry drop is well worthwhile and the final drop is a challenge too.<span xml:lang="en-US"> </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Looking upstream on the road bridge will give an idea of the water level. The top fall doesn’t need a lot of water to be worth a few laps. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From Castle Douglas, drive up the A713 to St John’s Town of Dalry. Take the first right, then carry straight on at the crossroads and follow the B7000 for 4½ miles until you get to the <span xml:lang="en-US">road bridge that crosses the river.</span> Carry your boat upstream for 800m along the public footpath to the waterfall. Put in on the flat section just upstream. The river eventually flattens out into a loch, so the take-out, just after the road bridge, is obvious.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">The two-stage fall is around 6m high, and can be easily inspected. Setting up safety cover is tricky and the second drop has a powerful retentive hole if you get off-line. Further downstream a small weir may need to be inspected if the river is high. </span>Before the loch there is one more rapid of note. In high water conditions it can be shot over the middle, but in low conditions the water flows river right over a fall whose exit is partly blocked by a submerged rock. Make your own mind up about this one, but safety cover is a good idea.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Make sure you inspect downstream of the bridge before you commit to this section as the level of the loch below can change suddenly due to the hydro intake just downstream; this affects the landing on the last drop.</p>
