			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The River Isla makes a dubious trip in a deep gorge from Reekie Linn, just below the B954 at Bridge of Craigisla, to the bridge on the<br />Alyth road (see Melgan description). There are several awkward portages and few runnable rapids. In fact, this trip is really just canyoning with a boat. Perhaps if you make the first descent of ‘the Linn’ you may be the kind of paddler who will find this stretch worthwhile. Having said that, the trip gets a surprising number of repeat descents, even if just for the novelty of leading others down to the ledge in the depths of the gorge with no apparent portage. Throw your boat in from the ledge on river left, then jump in after. Definitely stay away at high flows!</p>
