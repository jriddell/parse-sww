			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Situated in Royal Deeside close to the famous crags of Lochnagar, the Muick is a fast, bouncy grade 3 boulder trip, divided into 2 sections by the impressive Linn of Muick.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Unless it’s brown and churning, this river will feel like a rocky ditch. More ballsy than technical, the 10m falls can be paddled at low flows, when the rest would not be worth contemplating.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Take the B976 from Ballater towards Braemar. After less than a mile, at Bridge of Muick, turn off upstream. After about 1½ miles, a road leads down to the take-out bridge. To reach the put-in, return to the road up the glen, and continue on for another 3 miles to the next bridge. Find a lay-by in the section above the bridge and carry down to the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Starting off open, as the river flows under the first bridge the gradient increases slightly, giving fast continuous grade 3+ water with the odd good ‘catch it if you can’ wave. This is read and run territory, crashing through waves and avoiding small pour-overs, making up the line as you go. The Linn of Muick comes up less than a kilometre after the bridge. Make sure you take out in plenty of time. This would not be a good one to do by accident! Below the falls, there is more of the same, although the features are slightly more broken with fewer surfable waves.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Linn itself comprises a 4m ramp into a messy lip with a boulder on the right. At low flows this may cause damage while at high flows it produces a rooster tail kicking onto rocks. The ramp should be run pointing left to avoid this. The lip is ill defined, particularly at high flows, where it is almost impossible to get a boof in. People have hit the bottom at fairly high flows and flat landings at low flow hurt. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent para-style-override-5">The Gairn lies across the valley from Glen Muick and is easily accessed from the A939. It’s a reasonably large river and relatively straightforward for much of its length. There is some white water in the last kilometre at Bridge of Gairn, before the confluence with the Dee. At high flows this is grade 3/4.<span></span></p>
