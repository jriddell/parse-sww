			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the A970 driving north, take the right-hand turn signposted for Nesting, just after the Loch of Girlsta. The burn runs under the road soon after the junction, before a turning on the left. Park in a lay-by just after the bridge. This is essentially a one rapid wonder, but walk as far up as you like.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is one rapid, Triple Step, and a small chute, which can be seen by crossing the fence at the bridge. The first part of Triple Step is nothing worrying. However, the second and third step come immediately after each other with very little time to manoeuvre. In all water levels, the pools are shallow so a good boof is required to see you through this without pinning. A sharp undercut on the river right at the bottom of the third step could also cause difficulty. After this, you can either get out, or paddle the last smaller drop and paddle out into the voe.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Not one to be attempted unless a confident boof is assured. Pins can happen and with the tightness of the drops it would be difficult to get anyone out in high water when the water is running quite powerfully.</p>
