			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Drive north from Lerwick up the A970 (the main road in Shetland running north-south). Just before reaching the village of Voe, there’s a left turn sign-posted for Aith. Turn here and follow this road (B9071) for a few miles. Drive down around the head of two voes (the local word for sea loch), the second of which is the outlet for the Burn of Lunklet, and which is handily sign-posted for walkers. Park in the lay-by on the right-hand side of the road, just after the bridge. It’s now boats on shoulders time, as you follow the well-maintained footpath up to the main drop on the burn. From here the path narrows, but is walkable for another kilometre or so, to where a fence crosses (and blocks) the river. Get on here and paddle back to your car!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At the take-out bridge, if it looks scrapeable, it is runnable higher up as the river is much narrower there. If the water is deep at the bridge, it should be a great run. If it doesn’t look as if you’d want to paddle at the bridge, it would be sensible to go elsewhere. The river holds its water reasonably well, however, so a couple of days after a torrential downpour it may still be going.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This run should be scouted on the walk up as there are two sections to be aware of. The <br />character is set from the put-in, a narrow burn but with some interesting drops. The run begins with small grade 2 drops and chutes, the challenge to slalom down the deepest line and not get beached in lower water. In higher<br />water, it remains grade 2 but it’s easier to keep the boat floating. The first technical rapid comes after around 500m, and is best inspected on the walk up. A small chute river right is followed sharply by a 1m drop river left. The bottom of this hides some submerged rocks, even in high flows, so a good boof is needed to make sure you don’t get pinned at the bottom. After this you soon come to the main event, the Falls of Lunklet. A 2.5m drop that you cannot miss on the hike up. Inspection is possible from the large rocks in the centre if you wish to pick your line. It’s essentially a long rock-slide river right in low water, or a boof on the left at higher flows. The pool below is deep here, so no worries about pinning. The left-hand channel of the falls is not advised as there are<br />numerous ledges underneath here. From the falls, it’s easy water down to the get-out.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river above the fence may be runnable in extremely high water. Just above the fence it splits into three tributaries, the centre burn being loch fed. There is a gorge section up this run which may be doable, but would require a lot of water. There is also a significant tributary, the Burrafirth Burn, which meets the Burn of Lunklet just before the take-out. This hasn’t been run but looks like a good area for beginners.</p>
