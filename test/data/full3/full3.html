			<p class="Section-heading">Strathspey</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The Spey and Findhorn are the two main rivers of this area and, to many, need no introduction. The Spey is one of the major rivers of Scotland, ninth longest in the UK and Scotland’s fastest flowing river, but it does perhaps offer more to the touring paddlers or salmon fishermen than the white</span><span xml:lang="en-US">-</span><span>water enthusiast. The Findhorn more than makes up for this. A large river, it offers no less than four </span><span xml:lang="en-US">white-</span><span>water runs. There are some good tributaries in the upper reaches of the Spey such as the Feshie, Tromie and Calder, and Aviemore, perhaps, makes the best base for exploring these. Outdoor gear shops and a selection of fine ‘nighteries’ provide all the ingredients for a fine paddling destination. Strathspey is not blessed with as much rain as its western or northern neighbours. Watch out for weather systems sweeping in from the north-east, as these can feed the rivers of this region well. Melting snow from the Cairngorm Mountains can also provide high flows so it’s worth watching for any sharp rise in temperature in the months of March or April which might strip the mountains of their wintry cover.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-1"><a id="Anchor-7" />Findhorn</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Findhorn runs north into the Moray Firth near Forres. Draining the Monadhliath Mountains, its upper reaches are largely flat and braided<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> not holding much interest for the white<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>water paddler, although there is some steep creeking potential in the very highest reaches. In its last 24km, the river contains a series of pleasant gorges giving white water of all levels. There are four sections that are regularly paddled, the choice being generally dependent on the ability of the paddlers concerned and the amount of water around.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span class="Pesda-Bold--Emphasis-" xml:lang="en-US">Top</span> – Good spate boating at grade 3.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span class="Pesda-Bold--Emphasis-" xml:lang="en-US">Upper</span> – A grade 3/4 section that needs medium to high flows, this is a great section for developing river running skills.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span class="Pesda-Bold--Emphasis-" xml:lang="en-US">Middle</span> –&#160;A great coaching section at grade 2/3. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span class="Pesda-Bold--Emphasis-" xml:lang="en-US">Lower Gorge</span> –&#160;This is a classic stretch of river. At grade 4(5) it’s considerably harder than the other sections and can be run with less water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Parking is generally quite limited with other users, such as walkers, also looking for space. This is particularly the case at Randolph’s Leap, which often attracts a number of visitors. Please keep the number of vehicles to a minimum, park considerately and change discreetly. This is a tranquil area and general noise and disturbance should be kept to a minimum.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The top section runs from Banchor to Dulsie, just off the B9007 well north of Carrbridge. This is a wonderful, short and exciting trip through open gorge scenery.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Check the level at Dulsie Bridge; if there is enough water flowing down the right-hand side of the large rock slab on the bottom fall of the Dulsie rapid to paddle this channel, the river is high and this section will be a super paddle. A full river-width stopper above the final drop tells its own story – the river is stonking at this level. A reading of 0.4 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From Dulsie Bridge, find the minor road on river<br />left. At Banchor, where the road descends to the river for the first time, there is limited parking on a grassy area at the bottom of the hill on the left-hand side of the road. Put in down a steep slope from here. Access through this area should be maintained for estate vehicles. Take out on river left below Dulsie Bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Starting with shallow shingle banks, the river<br />quickly closes in to flow through an open gorge for most of its length to Dulsie Bridge. Rapids are frequent with plenty of interest on them. This section offers great training with plenty of waves, playspots and downriver moves. All the rapids can be run by boat scouting, but if the need arises inspection and safety are easy to arrange. Inspection of Dulsie Rapid (Gd 4) from the right-hand bank is possible but can be awkward. It may be simpler to check it out from the top of the bank prior to commencing the trip.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A longer trip, this stretch from Dulsie Bridge to Ardclach churchyard (Ferness) is excellent for both the intermediate paddler and the developing leader to expand their skills.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If the rapid at Dulsie Bridge looks low, the<br />river will become scrapey and less worthwhile. A reading of 0.3 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At Dulsie Bridge, a path leads down to the river on river left. To put in above Dulsie, gain access across a grassed area through a gate at the parking lay-by. Care has to be taken to cross a barbed wire fence on this pathway and the subsequent steep descent to the river. Paddlers have occasionally been challenged gaining access directly above Dulsie rapid. It is possible to take out at Ardclach church, or Logie Bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This trip is mostly grade 3 with shingle banks and little drops. It has one little gorge section, Levens Gorge (Gd 4), where the river sweeps round a left-hand bend and the water is channelled into the gorge entrance via a drop on river left. There is a beach on river right where inspection and safety can be carried out. The line is fairly obvious: the pour-over on the right-hand side of the drop should normally be avoided. The gorge section should generally be run towards the left-hand side, as there is a hidden sump in the rock formation on river right. After this the river opens up again with enough variation to maintain the paddler’s interest. One other drop in an open gorge section is about 2km above the take-out and may require inspection, depending on the group’s abilities. This can be done from the shingle banks on river right.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Following this rapid the river opens up, and a leisurely paddle follows down to the take-out at Ardclach Church. Paddle down to the large eddy on the left and walk up the bank to find the path to the church car park. Do not get out above this, as it will involve walking across a field to the car. The farmer has expressed serious concerns about paddlers causing disturbance to his animals in this field. An alternative egress is at Logie Bridge 2km further downstream.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Parking is limited at Dulsie Bridge and the surfaced car park at the church is for visitors to the graveyard. This is still in use and burials continue to happen despite the church being derelict. It is best to avoid this area during funeral services.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A long trip, which can be broken down into shorter sections, this is an excellent stretch for paddlers to polish up on their technique. It is also a good section for developing leadership skills with a variety of rapids, all of which can be run from the river. If required, inspection and safety can easily be achieved.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Best done at medium to high levels; at low<br />levels it can be fun, but a bit of a scrape on the shallower sections. Have a quick level check at the put-in. If the river is floatable here the section will be passable. For the upper section, 0.3 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a mini-<br />mum flow. Around 1 is intermediate-friendly.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Ardclach Churchyard – NH 953 450 (57.4833, -3.7468)</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Logie Bridge – NH 959 462 (57.4943, -3.7375) – 2km paddling from Ardclach. The farmer’s access must be maintained at all times. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Relugas Bridge – NH 986 488 (57.518135, -3.6943) – just below Dalltullich, 7km paddling from Ardclach.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Randolph’s Leap – NJ 000 495 (57.5250, -3.6713) – lay-by beside the road, 9km paddl-<br />ing from Ardclach. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From Ardclach the river starts off at grade 3 and remains steady at this grade until just after Logie Bridge. It then runs through some shingle/rocky grade 2 rapids for about 3km. After a right-hand bend, the river gathers in a large pool just before a noticeably bigger drop and rapid, known locally as either The Wall of Death or Dragon’s Teeth. This rapid is normally run on river right, from which side it can easily be inspected. Shortly after this rapid, in high water, a green wave is formed across the river,<br />which can give fantastic surfing. Following this wave is the approach to Carnage Corner just above Relugas Bridge. This rapid is normally run on river left, avoiding the natural weir-type rock formation across the remainder of the river. The left-hand chute can give good pop-outs and is worth a play. Take out on river<br />left, upstream of the bridge. Alternatively, a further 2km of grade 3 paddling takes you to Randolph’s Leap. Take out river right in a large eddy just at the narrow entrance into the next gorge section. Carry up the steep and rocky path to a wooded area and on to the road.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Two headstones beside the path, within the wooded area, indicate the height the river rose to in the 1829 floods.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Randolph’s Leap to Sluie Farm is a classic stretch of river. It makes an exciting and quite demanding trip for the experienced leader and intermediate paddler ready to progress onto heavier and more technical water. The feeling of remoteness deep in the gorge gives an<br />added edge to the paddle, but a number of playspots on the way down allow some relaxing moments and the opportunity to appreciate the beauty of the gorge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The gorge can be run when the river is low, but becomes a bit rocky in places. In extremely high conditions, it will be a grade harder and probably better left to experienced paddlers who enjoy boils. If Randolph’s can be run on the right-hand side, with the only way out via the cauldron, the level is low to medium. If after running Randolph’s you can exit by the right-hand chute thereby avoiding the cauldron, the river is medium to high. At this level, the water through the gorge is quite powerful with eddies full of boils; a swim could be long and uncomfortable. A reading of 0.2 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum flow. Around 1.0 is a friendly level.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Turn off the A940 onto the B9007. A lay-by serving the viewpoint for Randolph’s Leap provides car parking. A network of footpaths on the opposite side of the road leads you down to various access points along the river. If you wish to paddle the leap, take a set of steps off the road opposite the south end of the lay-by giving you access to the large eddy above the narrow entrance into the lead-in to Randolph’s. To avoid this fairly serious start, take the gate access opposite the north end of the lay-by and follow the path down to the river. When you come to the top of the bank turn right and follow the path until you come to a steep branch down to the river. A strand of wire has been fixed to give support on this descent.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Randolph’s Leap is a grade 4+ rapid with some scary rock formations. It can be anything from straightforward to testing depending on water levels. After Randolph’s, the river runs up to grade 3 for about 1.5km until it passes Logie Estate Farm and House on the right bank. It now enters the gorge with the pace picking up and the difficulty gradually increasing.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Shortly after a heavier rapid, which runs round a right-hand bend, you encounter the first grade 4, Triple Steps. The second of these steps is normally run on the left as there have been a number of pinnings on the right drop. In big water, the stopper formed at the bottom of the third drop becomes quite serious and will recirculate a swimmer. After a short breather and one further drop comes Corkscrew, which can be inspected from a small beach on river right. The slab formation in the centre of the river on the first drop forms a horizontal corkscrew effect at certain levels, hence the name. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The next rapid of note is about 500m further on and drops into a short narrow gorge section with a fairly heavy stopper to catch the unwary. This brings you quickly to The Slot, found to the left of a large rock that splits the river. Normally portaged, the drop is still occasionally paddled, but may result in paddler, boat and all being sucked under the undercut central rock, to be exited some distance below. It is almost impossible to tell if there is any debris<br />in this undercut, so the general advice is to portage. This rapid should not be underrated. At high levels, the drop to the left can be run. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is the end of the serious rapids and the fun time begins. There are a number of good playspots<span xml:lang="en-US">;</span> it’s up to you to find them! The take-out is on river right, next to some obvious sandstone cliffs, about 300m below the last rapid. You can just spot the footpath meandering up the steep slope that takes you to the Mains of Sluie Farm.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Please park at the Sluie Walk car park on the west side of the A940. The little cottages at the Mains of Sluie have been converted to a cottage and bunkhouse. The occupants are definitely paddler friendly but take care to change discreetly and out of view. There is the opportunity to bring vehicles down to pick up boats<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> with a place to do this where you can turn and change out of view of the houses (NJ 008 525 57.5522, -3.6579).</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">An awesome river that probably doesn’t get paddled enough, the Divie flows </span>from the Dava Moors to join the lower section of the Findhorn. A cracking spate paddle, giving continuous interest with twisting rapids and mini-<br />gorges, it is often paddled in conjunction with the Findhorn Gorge for a full day out.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river has <span xml:lang="en-US">only </span>a small catchment, so it needs to have been raining hard. Follow the road just below the Randolph’s Leap section to the bridge crossing the Divie. The rapid just upstream needs to be well covered, with the water a good peaty colour.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>Follow the A940 from Dava to the village of<br />Edin</span><span xml:lang="en-US">k</span><span>illie. Take the minor road running upstream alongside the river. The road passes a 7-arch stone viaduct (constructed in 1863 as part of the original main Highland Railway line). Put in at a small lay-by near the river. The trip finishes at the bridge just before the confluence with the Findhorn, downstream of Randolph’s Leap. Cars can be left at the put-in for the Findhorn Gorge, or if you fancy a longer paddle, at the take-out by the Mains of Sluie.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The river kicks off gently, with a few trees scattered here and there. It increases to grade 2/3 as you pass under the viaduct and approach the bridge in Edinkillie. Get out river left immediately after the bridge to scout the first grade 4, which is trickier than it looks. There is a funky lead-in to a 1m drop with a sticky stopper at the bottom, which is best hit with speed going right. To make this rapid all the more entertaining, just at the top of the drop</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> </span><span>on river left is a nasty-looking undercut rock. Straight after the collecting pool is a grade 3 S-bend with a small stopper in the middle. The river now flattens out to give pleasant grade 2/3 read and run. This is followed by the first grade 3/4 gorge, with a small drop into a narrowing and a couple of waves and holes to keep you on your toes. A dilapi-<br />dated footbridge signals another drop as the river narrows into a ‘V’ shape and a small ramp with a sometimes sticky hole at the bottom. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">As the river opens up, the Dorback Burn enters on your left and you pass the estate house. After this you enter the best of the river, all grade 3 read and run with some fun drops and interesting rapids. At the time of writing (Nov 2016), about 500m down the section from the estate house, there was a big tree blocking the whole river in the middle of a small rapid. Not long after, a trickier grade 3 drop tries to push you up against the left-hand wall. Grade 3 continues, but be on your guard as the Falls of Fealkirk are not far away; their location marked by a handy viewing platform. Take care making your way down this section as the eddy above the falls is very small and could probably only take two boats. Get out on river left and slog up the muddy wooded bank. Our recommendation would be to send someone up with a line and pull the boats up one at a time. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Falls of Fealkirk (Gd 5) are made up of three tricky drops in quick succession, a big undertaking and tricky to protect, which makes them all the more intimidating. Most opt to portage, and follow the steep steps down from the viewing platform to the big pool.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The final grade 3 rapid on the Divie comes straight after the falls. It’s a fast chute into a small hole but it’s worth being aware of the tree which runs along the length of this rapid underwater. The river finishes off with some nice grade 2 rapids to end a cracking trip in a quality place. There’s even a nice path at the bridge on river left which leads you back up the road.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a real adventure which, apart from the first grade 4 rapid and the falls, isn’t that hard. The blind corners and jungle-like banks add to the feeling of jeopardy, and make scouting a challenge. The river lends itself to read and run paddling, but getting out to look is always an option. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A major river system which provides year-round interest for the touring paddler, the Spey is navigable for most of its length, some 120km. There are dedicated guidebooks available for the river and information on the SCA website if you’re planning a multi-day trip. The most popular stretch, as described here, runs from Ballindalloch down to Tamdhu Distillery and will take 3–4 hours to paddle with a novice<br />group in normal flows.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Spey can be paddled in almost all conditions. A reading of 0.4 on the SEPA gauge would be considered low.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach Ballindalloch from Grantown-on-Spey, drive north-east on the A95, turn off at Advie, crossing the river at Advie Bridge. Turn right onto the B9102 and drive downstream for 3 miles to the Ballindalloch Ayeon Pool, some half a mile downstream of the old access point at ‘March Pool’ where a large fence was erected in 2016. There is vehicular access through the gate via a good track into a field with a surfaced turning circle, close to the river. To facilitate responsible toileting, a portable toilet (funded by paddlers) is available at this location from mid-March to mid-Oct. The take-out is at the Tamdhu distillery. Drive North on the B9102 turning off right to the distillery at Knockando. There is ample parking close to the old railway line, but please do not obstruct the footpath. There is a changing hut and composting toilet on the path to the river. Please be respectful and use these facilities.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>From the put-in at Ballindalloch, the river<br />strolls down at a leisurely pace to the old railway bridge, past a left-hand bend and on to the confluence with the River Avon (</span><span xml:lang="en-US">pronounced Aann)</span><span>. Here a short rapid forms round the right-hand bend. This is followed by another straightforward rapid with a wave in the centre, which makes a good spot to learn to surf. The river bends left as it approaches Blacks Boat Rapid or The Washing Maching (Gd 2). This is a long ramp of fast water, followed by a wave train. For the next 3km the river eases with many short rapids and waves. Continue until the river bends to the right and the Tamdhu Distillery comes into view. This signals the approach to Knockando (Gd 2). The rapid provides interest in most conditions, although it can become a little washed out when the river<br />is high. The take-out is immediately below the rapid on the left bank, with a steep path leading up to the old disused railway platform.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Set at the northern foot of the Cairngorm Mountains in Moray, the river can be paddled from just east of Tomintoul to the River Spey at Ballindalloch. The Avon (<span xml:lang="en-US">pronounced Aann)</span> is a spate run through shingle banks with occasional smooth rocky rapids, surrounded by open wooded banks and fields. Although the full trip is very long, it can be broken down to shorter lengths using various lay-bys and access at bridges along the route.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river has to be high to make this trip worthwhile; the higher the better. The river level drops very quickly, almost overnight. After<br />prolonged rain or snow melt it rises quickly and flash floods have been witnessed. Rescue can be difficult due to lack of good eddies and a swim may be a long one. The river level can be checked and viewed from various points along the A939 Bridge of Avon to Tomintoul Road, or the B9136 Bridge of Avon to the Ballindalloch Road. When no bedrock is showing through the rapids, the level will be at least medium. Around 0.8 on the SEPA Gauge would be considered low.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river can be accessed from the various road bridges. To the east of Tomintoul on the minor road to Delnabo Estate, parking is available at the Queen’s View. From here it is a short walk down to the river at the road bridge. The next bridge is close to the junction of the A939 and B9136 at Bridge of Avon. Park in the lay-by on the downstream side of the A939 road bridge, river left (NJ 149 199; 57.2622, -3.4109). The next take out is on river right just below Ballindalloch Bridge on the A95. There is generally limited parking close by at the war memorial.<br />Alternatively, you can continue on down to join the River Spey with possible egress at Knockando Rapid (see River Spey description).</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">For much of its length, the Avon flows over open shingle and boulder banks. At high flows, these give playful wave trains and some stoppers that you may think twice before exploring. At dry low levels, the river becomes bumpy and scrapey and it is best to retain your plastic for another day. Distillery Falls is the main event of the river (NJ 149 257; 57.3140, -3.4128). The buildings of the distillery come into view on river right and serve as a warning of the rapid approaching. This two-tier drop is normally taken on the right. Just below this rapid is a footbridge; you can take out on river left and walk over the bridge and up a footpath taking you onto the B9136. There is a lay-by, which parks a maximum of two cars, on the north side of the road to the west of the distillery. Although fishermen use this lay-by, it is unlikely to be in use by them at the level that you are paddling the river. Continuing on downstream, there is a minor road bridge and some parking on river left about 2km below here. The trip meanders on to the take-out at Ballindalloch.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-1"><a id="Anchor-12" />Dulnain</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Dulnain flows into the Spey upstream of Grantown on Spey. Most of the Dulnain has a gentle gradient which offers little in the way of white water. However, two short sections do provide some pleasant grade 3, the lower section rising to grade 4 in big spate conditions. These sections are good for intermediate paddlers when the river is just high enough to be worth paddling and advanced paddlers will enjoy it as a quick blast in spate.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The lower section is best started at Balnaan, with a choice of egress at Dulnain Bridge, the new A95 road bridge or on the Spey.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Starting at Balnaan provides a short warm-up before the gradient steepens and the fun begins. This section is not desperately difficult, and a big man-made wall on river right heralds the first and biggest drop on the river which is usually run just left of centre. After this is a long boulder garden with plenty of small eddies, little waves and playful pour-overs – it’s quality grade 3 fun. An eddy on the upstream right of the bridge in Dulnain should not be missed if you want to stop and play.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The small stopper above the bridge is ideal for teaching basic freestyle moves but it is too small, shallow and flushy even for experts to throw lots of vertical ends here. Take out 50m below the bridge on the left to follow a footpath and steps up to the road and ample car parking in the old garage forecourt. You can continue downstream for a little more grade 2 action and egress at the new A95 road bridge or on to the Spey<span xml:lang="en-US">. H</span>owever the Dulnain Bridge take-out is the easiest. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The lower section can be done as a ‘park and play’ trip as it is only a few hundred yards to carry up from the car park at the old garage to the first significant drop.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This run is worth doing for novelty value on the way back from something good, or if you live locally, just to say you’ve paddled the beast!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Everything needs to be tanking. Look over the bridge in Nethybridge. If the river looks like it will go then it probably will. If it looks scrapey then don’t bother. Brown peaty water that’s moving fast would be ideal.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The footbridge in Nethybridge is easy to access<br />for a 1km run. Drive on the road from the Spar and take the first left you come to. This will lead down to the green footbridge where you can get on. The easiest place to get off is Broomhill Bridge on the Spey.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Nethy is a grade 2 rollercoaster at high flows with, surprisingly, some good waves to surf. There is one small drop about half-way down, which is slighty harder (Gd 3-). It could be a good introduction to spate rivers for an intermediate paddler but be aware that, once you’re on, its everyone for themselves. Watch out for strainers and low-lying trees</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">You can start higher up near Forest Lodge which apparently has some nice rapids but we’ve always just started in the village.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a small continuous spate burn, where the fun never lets up. Flowing from the Cairngorm ski area, near Aviemore, it makes a good alternative to skiing or winter climbing when conditions are bad. It’s rather bizarre going to a ski centre for a paddle, but it’s a fun run!!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river needs to be absolutely going off. It requires really heavy rain plus snow melt in order to bring it up to, and past, bank full. Late winter is often a good time to try and catch it. Follow the road uphill from Glenmore village. After about a mile you reach a road bridge over a braided stretch of river. This needs to be well covered with enough water to float over the boulders. The rest of the river is more channelled.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the A9 turn off towards Aviemore. Follow the signs to Glenmore then continue for a further mile to the second road bridge (see above). The egress point is 250m downstream, at the footbridge. If the level is right, follow the road up to Cairngorm Ski Centre and park in the lowest of the car parks. The put-in is only a few metres away.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The burn is continually very tight, steep and exciting. There are no eddies and the only way to stop is to hang onto a lump of turf, which usually results in spinning round and running the burn backwards until you can turn back round – even more wicked fun. As the gradient steepens the action heats up to give continuous drops into shallow pools. All too soon, the burn spills into the Allt Mor. From here the run is steady at first. However, you soon pass the footbridge by the reindeer compound, below which the river splits. Check your choice of channel, </span><span xml:lang="en-US">and </span><span>take a deep breath. The pace picks up here with steep continuous boulder rapids. Watch out for fallen trees. Once past the road bridge, the burn eases as you near the take-out. It is possible to continue for an extra kilometre, but it is a bit of an anti-climax, with little technical interest and plenty of tree problems.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If you enjoyed this run and don’t mind some walking, it is possible to paddle the other branch of the Allt Mor, above the confluence with the Cas Burn. For this, follow the climbers’ path into Coire an t-Sneachda for as long as it seems possible to paddle. Elbow pads are useful, more to save your cag than your elbows. Be warned – this river has been variously described as grade 3 or grade 5, depending on who you talk to. Keep an open mind and make your own decision.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Eidart and Top Feshie is a mega wilderness adventure. We ended up doing it as a multi-<br />day trip with 13 hours of paddling. There’s a lot of really good white water on this trip, but beware, it has the potential to be a major epic.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If it’s not wet, don’t go. You’ll need it to be raining consistently for the two hours before you paddle. It took us many attempts to get enough water and then, when we did, we had a little too much!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Park in Achlean car park as per the normal Feshie run. It took us 5 hours in windy conditions to carry the boats the 8km to the put-in and no less than six attempts to get the required flow. It may be best to take the boats in beforehand, or know someone with a helicopter to drop them off … we didn’t. Following the Carn Ban Mor track from Achlean, you gain a height of 1030m on the walk-in.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Given the adventurous nature of this paddle, if you need a blow-by-blow description don’t go there. We decided the first 500m were too out of control given the water level, remoteness and our small party of two. Hurt yourself here and you’re a long way from anywhere, especially in the weather you’re likely to be here in. The first 500m would offer serious sliding fun and, if it wasn’t so remote, would be a classic in its own right. We put in just before the confluence of the other major Eidart tributary at (NN 917 946). Frequent grade 4 drops break up the slightly bony run down to the Eidart Gorges.<br />Watch out for these gorges, which contain some portages. The final gorge finishes in the biggest waterfall, at 8m, underneath a metal footbridge 500m before the Feshie. Although it was August, we ran out of daylight by this point. We found the remains of a hut and slept on upturned kayaks covered with heather, as flashes of lightning lit the sky. The next day we paddled the Top Feshie, which has lots of good grade 4 and 5 white water – we paddled some and walked some. The exciting paddling continued for about 4km with a class 6(?) drop marking the end of this section. 11km of grade 2/3 float and scrape, with stunning scenery, led to the take-out at Achlean car park. This is the put-in for the regular Upper Feshie. We talked about carrying on, but didn’t have it in us.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Note the approach to this river requires a map and compass and the knowledge to use them. It is a seriously remote mountain paddle. For a bigger scale map use OS ‘Outdoor Leisure 3’ 1:25000 ‘The Cairngorms, Aviemore &amp; Glen Avon’.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Feshie is a major tributary of the Spey, which drains the western fringe of the Cairngorm Mountains. It joins the River Spey at the small village of Kincraig, halfway between<br />Aviemore and Kingussie. In its upper reaches<br />the river is generally straightforward with shingle rapids. A short lower gorge provides the best of the white water, making a good intermediate trip with a couple of usable playspots in high water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The last gorge can be entertaining even without much water. Higher flows are required to avoid a bump and a scrape in the upper section. Check the flow at Feshiebridge on the B970, near the take-out. If all the rocks are covered in the last rapid the river is at a good level. If some rocks are still showing the upper stretch could be a bit scrapey. A reading of 0.7 on the SEPA gauge should be considered to be the lowest paddling level.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The put-in for this upper stretch is at Achlean Farm. Vehicles should be parked at the roadside on the high ground before reaching the croft. To get to the river without causing conflict, follow the path upstream, above and away from the croft. Please do not cut through the steading or cross the moorland immediately below or downstream of the croft. To access the upper rapids if you don’t have a shuttle, it is possible to park by the cattle grid before the woods (after Glen Feshie Hostel), and walk down to the river on forestry land (before the cattle grid/fence). Walking upstream for 150m gives access to some nice rapids. For those more interested in paddling the gorge, it is possible to drop off boats at the road bridge and walk up the ‘right of way’ on river left, for around 400m. Take out at the car park 100m downstream of Feshiebridge. Please use this car park to keep the road and Glen Tilt track free.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The first rapid below Achlean is some 200m long with one small chute. This is followed by a series of fast but flat stretches of water interspersed with a series of small interesting falls requiring some judgement. Below Tolvah, the river becomes grade 2 with shingle rapids<br />as the river becomes braided and shallow for a couple of miles. Throughout this section, watch out for damaged fencing which may hang in or above the river. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">After this quiet stretch, the left bank becomes steeper and the gorge begins. Just upstream of Lagganlia Centre on a left-hand bend a small stream, the <a id="x.21304" />Allt <span xml:lang="en-US">a’</span>Mharcaidh, enters from the right. The river is about grade 2 at this point. The stretch from here to Feshiebridge provides some interesting grade 3+ paddling in good conditions. The grade can go up considerably in high water. It is possible to view the lower part of this stretch from the road bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Look out for fences in the upper stretch, and for fallen trees, which may become lodged in the gorge. Lagganlia Centre has accommodation for paddlers and runs canoe/kayak courses.<br />Residents have unlimited access to the Feshie through their grounds.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Tromie is a tributary of the Spey that runs roughly parallel with the Feshie, its eastern neighbour. The Tromie, and most particularly the one major rapid above and below the B970 bridge, is a river which should be treated with respect. Above this rapid lies plenty of fast grade 2/3, but even this is not really a place for novices. In essence, this is a short 300m ‘park and blast’ for competent paddlers.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the put-in from Tromie Bridge walk up the private road on river right. You can choose to put on in several different places, wherever the road comes close to the river. After 3km the road crosses the river; an obvious put-in if you fancy walking that far. Take out on river left after the B970 bridge. There is a path back to the bridge where you can park easily enough.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Tromie is by no means a classic Scottish run, but it is good sport at high flows. The gradient from the top of the single-track road is fairly even and thus offers a steady and continuous grade 3 ride in spate conditions. It is not technically difficult but eddies are hard to find because the river is often in among the trees or nudging ever-higher over the shallow banks. The occasional stopper forms over larger<br />boulders, but most of the river bed is shingle until you reach the harder rocks which form the rapids before the take-out. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Although the final rapid has no big, scary waterfall or elbow-bashing constriction it does have some retentive holes which you don’t want to play with. A swim here would hurt more than your pride, and you need to be on the right line from top to bottom to avoid trouble. Hit the right lines and it runs very sweetly indeed, grade 4 at its lowest runnable level and worth a 5 in spate. Note that less than 200m downstream of this rapid is a shallow weir which forms a very even and holding stopper at some levels, so your safety and rescue plans should consider this feature.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There is a lot of other short and exciting stuff nearby (Calder, Feshie, Cas, Falls of Truim) and if the Tromie is up, these are also likely to be flowing well.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>On the western edge of the Cairngorms, the River Calder crosses the A86 at Newtonmore, and is a small tributary of the Spey. A nice little<br />spate river, it is navigable from quite far up the glen, although the best of the paddling is generally considered to be found in the lower gorge. The run consists of a shallow lead</span><span xml:lang="en-US">-</span><span>in, followed by a small bedrock gorge, which is fun with the right amount of water. At very high flows, this run should be considered grade 5.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A good amount of water is required to make this a sporting run. To judge the level of the river, take a look from the road bridge on the A86. If it looks shallow but easily paddleable at this point then upstream will be fine. If it looks like a bump and scrape here, it will be even shallower above the gorge and probably not worth the effort.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The road bridge just west of Newtonmore on the road to Spean Bridge (A86) makes a suitable take-out. It is easily found and there is room to park upstream of the bridge on the river left. Finding the put-in is equally straightforward. Turn north in the town up the Old Glen Road and into the valley. The single-track road winds its way to a small car parking area close to a small bridge over an even smaller burn. Paddling down the burn offers a good alternative to walking down to the Calder. If the burn is too dry, it is likely that the Calder also needs more water. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river has been paddled from higher up, and this could be considered if you fancy a longer run. Alternatively, if you only have one car or the river is a bit low, the gorge section makes a great short run. Drop your boats off at the steep bank below the second cattle grid, park at the A86 take-out, and then walk back up the path – this lets you inspect the gorge as well. Follow the bobcat signposts after walking past the cemetery.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Initially the river just splashes its way over shingle beds. Dodging the odd boulder <span xml:lang="en-US">while </span>struggling to find the line with the most water is the biggest challenge. As you get warmed up so does the river, then the gorge begins. The change in character is fairly sudden as the river narrows into a channel cut through the banks of solid rock. The scale of things is still pretty small, as are the eddies, but you need a long neck to see around the corners and over the drops. At high water, you may prefer to inspect the whole gorge from the bank beforehand. However, once you enter the gorge you are not irreversibly committed as inspection or portaging remains possible all the way through. There is one corner which is just a little nastier than the rest. It has an undercut on the left, which could be problematic if you don’t have the right line. The little gorge ends almost as suddenly as it began and in no time at all you are at the main road bridge. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There are a number of other small burns in the area, which also run when the Calder is up. Try the Feith Talagain and the Rough Burn – creek boats and elbow pads are recommended.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Truim flows north from Dalwhinnie, joining the Spey by Newtonmore. A short distraction worth combining with a run on the Pattack or Calder, the Falls of Truim provide what is probably the river’s only real white water interest.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">It’s a bit of a lottery getting the right level. Peek over the bridge and eye up the falls. They will be better with a decent flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Take the second right travelling south on the A9 from Newtonmore. There is a car park on the left just after the turning. Park here and walk back towards the A9, taking the small road on the left down to the falls. Get on just above the minor road bridge, river left.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At a low level, the falls could be best summarised as, ‘short, scenic and silly’, best left to the salmon who can apparently be seen jumping there in the summer. At a higher water level, they are good for a short blast. Probably along the lines of, ‘short, scenic and sexy’, especially if you enjoy a slap in the face from a wet salmon.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Please don’t disrupt the otherwise peaceful lives of the residents who live in the house that overlooks the falls.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The River Tay drains a vast chunk of Scotland from Ben Lui in the west to Forfar in the east and from as far north as Glenshee, with its waters<br />eventually reaching the sea at Dundee. It is a fine river for touring and from source to sea it makes a fantastic journey. The two main white water sections can be found at Grandtully and Stanley. These sections are of interest to slalom paddlers, rafters and playboaters alike. It is, however, the Tay’s many tributaries that offer most to the white</span><span xml:lang="en-US">-</span><span>water paddler. This section is focused on those rivers that join the Tay in its western and central reaches. The runs in the extreme east of the catchment area can be found in the Eastern Promise section of the guide. Those looking for the hardest runs should make for the Keltney Burn, Bruar or Dall Burn. Great grade 4 boating can be found across the region from the Lochay and Dochart in the west to the Tilt and Braan in the east. Grade 3/4 runs such as the Gaur, Lyon and Tummel round off a superb area.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Garbh Ghaoir lies at the eastern edge of Rannoch Moor, at the end of one of Scotland’s longest cul-de-sacs: a wild and beautiful loca-<br />tion. Garbh means rough and this describes both the rapids and the granite boulders that characterise this little gem. The relative<br />remoteness provides a feeling of exploration.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If the Gaur is running, the Garbh Ghaoir will be a good paddle. If water is flowing over the Gaur dam, it will be in excellent condition.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Follow the B846 (forever) until the road ends at Rannoch Station, where ample parking is available. A careful crossing of the railway gives access to the Dubh Lochan and then Loch Laidon and the Garbh Ghaoir. The most practical egress is at the Gaur dam. Paddle the length of Loch <span xml:lang="en-US">Eigheach </span>and portage the dam on the right-hand side by the access road.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent para-style-override-4">The paddle across the spectacular Loch Laidon<br />and the search for the Garbh Ghaoir can be entertaining in itself. Once on the river, it calmly meanders until a sudden drop-off signals the start of two long boulder rapids, the second under a railway bridge. The river narrows and steepens again by a forest plantation. In high water the line on this drop is not obvious. More boulder rapids lead to a bouncy exit into Loch Eigheach.<span></span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Gaur makes up part of the Rannoch/Tummel hydro system. It flows in an easterly direction, into Loch Rannoch. When combined with the Garbh Ghaoir, this paddle makes a fine mini-<br />expedition through a beautiful open glen.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Very wet weather is needed to ensure that the power station is running, or better still, the Gaur dam is overflowing. The first rapid on the Gaur runs next to the road about 1km downstream of the dam. If rocks are visible but there is a clean line, the river is at a good height. If no rocks are showing, the river is running high and the stoppers will be big.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Park either off the road opposite the power<br />station alongside the river, or better still, continue to Rannoch station, and paddle the Garbh Ghaoir. Take out at Bridge of Gaur, on the left-hand side. Limited discreet parking is available on the south side of the bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The steep bouldery section directly below the dam is generally a good grade 4 when the dam is overflowing. However, it can become scarily big and has been run away from in very high water! The normal trip starts at the power station. After about 1km, the river narrows and flows alongside the road. A rounded boulder on the right signals the start of the first rapid. At grade 4, this is the hardest rapid on the section. Below this, the river calms until it reaches a large island. From here to the finish there is a series of continuous boulder rapids. In high water, large stoppers form in this section.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Loch Rannoch Ericht has a huge catchment, gathering water from the hills surrounding Loch Ericht and draining down into Loch Rannoch and the Tummel river system. Sadly most of the water that should flow down the Ericht is diverted by a hydro scheme. At first the river is open and very bouldery at low flows. The main gorge, which starts just after a small dam, is steeper and more serious. Bedrock is the scene from here on. The gorge itself is beautiful, but watch out for fences in the upper stretch.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Ericht can only be paddled when water is being released from the dam at Loch Ericht. The size of the plume gives an indication of the flow. If this looks massive, the river will be high.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Turn off the A9 just north of Pitlochry, heading towards Kinloch Rannoch. Follow the north shore for nearly 30 miles through Tummel Bridge and Kinloch Rannoch. At Bridge of<br />Ericht, turn off the main road towards Loch Ericht. A key can sometimes be arranged from Rannoch Power Station. Otherwise it’s a full-on 8km walk to the put-in. Park after the dam, at an old shed. Shuttle vehicles are best left before the power station on Loch Rannoch, where there is a lay-by on the left.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Initially the river is grade 2, but watch out for three fences, which need to be portaged. After about a kilometre a small dam appears which should be portaged on the left. Immediately after this is a grade 5 rapid. This may be shallow and should be boofed on the right. The river<br />continues, and then splits around an island. Take the left-hand channel, since the right goes over a nasty grade 6 drop. The left-hand side has a series of nice grade 3–5 rapids. The weir-like drop should be run down the middle<br />(Gd 4+). Small rapids continue to the loch. Turn left and paddle down to the car.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Dall Burn begins life on the high ground to the north of Glen Lyon. It flows through Rannoch Forest and is the best of the three small rivers running into the south side of Loch Rannoch. This is a small river with an unrelenting gradient in a beautiful forest setting, which provides some big pushy water with plenty of dubious looking falls. At the right flow it is a very fast and action packed trip.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is definitely one to keep for a wet day; perhaps the same heavy rainfall that would bring the Upper Keltney Burn into nick. Check the flow at the road bridge at the bottom of the river, just before it joins Loch Rannoch. At the right level, this section will look full and certainly not a bump and scrape. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From Kinloch Rannoch, take the road that leads along the south side of Loch Rannoch. You come to the Dall Burn a little under half a mile beyond the entrance to Rannoch School. This is the take-out. You need to leave your vehicle here and take your boat for a scenic wander on foot through the forest to find the put-in. A track leads upstream on river left past some houses and outbuildings of the school to a bridge over the river. About 200m beyond here you should branch left off the track and continue on river left via a path. Put in at the forest road bridge, 1.5km further upstream.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The action starts straightaway with good read and run water. As the gradient picks up you will want to scout the first large set of falls you come to. There are several drops in this section<br />and the overall impression at a high flow is that of big holes and shallow landings. In a couple of places there are staircase rapids of shallow angled slabs lying close together. It is generally easy to pick and choose which drops you want to run and those you’d rather not. After the bridge the gradient eases and it’s fast grade 3 water to the loch.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Dall Burn is the water supply for Rannoch School so please take care not to be the source of any pollution. The track to the put-in inv-<br />olves trekking past several of the buildings and houses associated with the school, so the run is probably best avoided by large noisy groups.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span class="Pesda-Italics char-style-override-2" xml:lang="en-US">“On the first and only time I have paddled the Dall Burn it was a wintry day with 6” of snow lying on the ground. Despite or perhaps because of the freezing temperatures we were keen to put on and get paddling as quickly as possible. As we flushed down the early rapids the trip was going well and we were getting in tune with the river. As we approached the first steepening I opted to run a small slab to gain an eddy which would give me a good view of the cascade below. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span class="Pesda-Italics char-style-override-2" xml:lang="en-US">Failing to punch the hole at the base of the slab, I had a short but frantic fight with the tow back before being drawn back into the hole. A solid drilling in the hole followed. As I was surfed I could feel that the situation was beginning to get a bit out of control. Despite my best efforts I was unable to escape the clutches of the stopper and each time I rolled up I was treated to a great view of the grade 5 falls which lay immediately below and which I was now resigned to swimming over. At some point I lost grip of my paddle and it wasn’t much longer before I opted to swim. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span class="Pesda-Italics char-style-override-2" xml:lang="en-US">Chris Forrest like all good paddling buddies had by now made the bank and was watching my trashing, throw-bag in hand. As I re-circed briefly in the hole he was able to bag me and drag my cold and shaken body to the side. The humiliation didn’t stop there as with no sign of my paddles I had to resort to dragging my boat back down through the forest. As I staggered through the snow drifts I had plenty of time in which to contemplate my mistake as I watched Chris run the classy stretch of water.<br />My description of the burn is based on the memory of this cold and hazy experience so best treat it as the uncontrolled ramblings of a deranged survivor. It could have been worse, at least I found my paddles in the loch!”</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Bruar flows into the Perthshire Garry, 9 miles north of Pitlochry. This is a short but sweet run with beautiful river features in a steep sided wooded gorge. The small drops are separated by tight sections which in high<br />water become challenging in themselves.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">You need a fair amount of rain to make this run worthwhile. Get it too high and there would be little space for scouting, too low and you would struggle to get through the tighter drops. The burn rises very quickly once the ground is wet. Go to the signpost on the path at the House of Bruar and look upstream. There should be enough water for you to scrape/float out. If it looks fast and brown then the river is scarily high.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The run is accessed from the Falls of Bruar Walk. Turn off the A9, some 9 miles north of Pitlochry, following signs for the Falls of Bruar. Head towards the House of Bruar Visitor Centre and park up. This is the take-out. To get to the put-in, it’s boats on shoulders time. Walk up the Falls of Bruar path, under the railway bridge and up, always up! The path is on<br />river right. Follow this all the way to an arched stone bridge over the river. It<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s possible to scout the river on the way up by peering into the gorge. The usual put-in is on river right, downstream of the bridge and below the fall. A slightly used path has been formed down the steep banking, which is likely to be slippy when the rain is coming down (the time you are most likely to be on the river).</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>There are a number of falls above the usual put-in, which the adventurous may wish to explore. The biggest of these is around 15m and will probably hurt </span><span xml:lang="en-US">–</span><span> decide for yourself! The drop just above the bridge may go, with a good bit of protection and the right water levels. The falls directly under the bridge are a no go with a shallow rocky pool. From below the bridge and natural rock arch the short section is classic pool-drop, with smooth slabby bedrock falls into what are, on the whole, clean pools. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the usual put-in pool, there are six drops in total, which are all fairly easy to scout from the river. The first drop is round a left-hand bend. From there you’re into the gorge proper and get a good view down into the depths as the sides close in. The rest of the trip is read and run, except at one narrower drop which is generally paddled on the right. Carry on until you <span xml:lang="en-US">reach</span> the signpost that you <span xml:lang="en-US">passed</span> on the way up.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At time of writing (2017) there are a couple of trees in the river. The second rapid is blocked at the exit; you can portage river right, but it’s slippy! The final fall has a tree 25m below the base of the fall. You can still run the drop but you have to clean it and go hard left to <span xml:lang="en-US">pass</span> the tree. There have never been any access problems here to my knowledge. However, the House of Bruar Visitor Centre is quite a classy place and I don’t think they would be too keen on a bunch of paddlers dropping their pants in the car park. Please be discreet, or better still change before you <span xml:lang="en-US">arrive</span>. The usual rules apply with walking up the path<span xml:lang="en-US"> –</span> closing gates etc.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Tilt is a classic north Perthshire river, which runs close to the A9 at the village of Blair Atholl. It is a major tributary of the River Garry. This is a spectacular trip through one of Scotland’s most beautiful glens. The river is continually ‘busy’, spending most of its time in a steep gorge. Unusual rock formations sloping down into the water with a number of rock shelves make up the best of the rapids. It’s a really excellent trip, that is always worth the walk-in.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The lower 3km of the river, from the first bridge reached travelling up Glen Tilt, can be scraped most of the year. The main run, from above Gilbert’s Bridge, is best at a higher flow. This can often be found in the winter and particularly during the spring run-off. The upper run, from the third bridge at Marble Lodge, requires very high flows. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Judge the flow from the road bridge in Blair Atholl. The river flows through a wide rocky river bed. If all rocks are covered the river is high. When the river is flowing in a third of the width of the river bed, it can be considered to be at a low level. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Flows around 0.8 on the Tilt@Marble Lodge SEPA gauge gives a great run. Above 1.2 will generally add a grade to most sections. The top gorge becomes continuous grade 5, while stopping before Chain Bridge Falls on the<br />lower might be an issue.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>To reach the river, turn off the A9 towards Blair Atholl, and follow the signs for the castle. Take the minor road opposite the Bridge of Tilt<br />Hotel. Turn left after about half a mile and cross the Old Bridge. There is a large car park here with a map showing the track up the glen. Currently there is no vehicular access permitted up Glen Tilt (Blair Atholl Estates). The track makes for an easy walk alongside the river to the put-ins. The 3km lower section starts from the first bridge (NN 880 684; 56.7945, -3.8338). If water levels allow it is definitely worth the effort to carry on to the second bridge (Gilbert’s) which gives a 4.5km run (NN 881 700; 56.8087, -3.8340). It</span><span xml:lang="en-US">’</span><span>s even worth going a little further than Gilbert’s Bridge </span><span xml:lang="en-US">in order to reach</span><span> Genesis</span><span xml:lang="en-US">,</span><span> a nice grade 3/4 warm-up rapid just above. Real hard cases carry on up to the third bridge at Marble Lodge for a 7km trip. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">Starting above Gilbert’s Bridge, you are straight into the action with Genesis (Gd 3/4); watch out for a meaty hole near the start. There is a brief chance to gather the pieces below this before the river charges down some excellent grade 3+ to the first bridge. This sets the tone for the river<br />to come, so if you’ve had a lot of </span><span xml:lang="en-US">swimmers it would be wise not to continue. After the bridge, there is a long grade 3 which leads straight into the entrance rapid for the upper gorge – Tory Backbencher (Gd 4). The name says it all on this rapid as you have to stick on the far right. The left feeds into a massive undercut so treat the lead-in rapid with respect. Inspection and portage is possible river right. Once you run Tory Backbencher you are committed to running the next rapid – Roller Coaster (Gd 4). This is an intimidating horizon line with no way to inspect or portage, but it runs really nicely on river right (left is bad – a theme on this river)! After Roller Coaster, there is time to get a swimmer out if you’re quick before you reach Sam’s Hole (Gd 4). This drop seems innocuous but can deliver a serious spanking if you get it wrong, especially in low water when more of the flow pushes into a large pothole on the left. It does clean up considerably in higher water. If you didn’t check it on the way up, make sure you scout this entire section river right to check it for trees.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Relax a little now as the gorge opens out. Exit Falls (Gd 3+) is the next horizon on a huge bend in the river and shouldn’t pose any difficulties. Some easy water leads down to the middle gorge and the descriptively named Boof and Narrows (Gd 4). This is a long rapid that splits into 3 sections in lower water – a very retentive hole, a narrow slot that is somewhat undercut and another narrow slot that is confused and boily. The halfway bridge comes up next, with easy access downstream on the right.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From here the river opens out a lot and there is continuous grade 3+ paddling until the banks start to wall-in again and there is a large river-<br />wide ledge followed by a sweeping dog-leg in the river. This can form a big hole in high water and is also your warning for the upcoming Chain Bridge Falls (Gd 5). Inspect on the left. The right-hand channel is a series of rocky drops and stoppers that look uninviting. A chicken chute (Gd 4/4+) opens up in medium water on the left. If you don’t fancy it, the seal launch from the rocks is great fun and leads you straight into the follow-up rapid known as Particle Accelerator for reasons that become obvious in higher water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">Down from </span><span xml:lang="en-US">here is a nice little ‘L’ shaped drop which gives a fantastic boof if you get it in just the right place (river left on the apex of the L), and then you are into the lower gorge </span><span xml:lang="en-US">– a fantastic grade 3/4 paddle full of blind bends, tiny eddies and spectacular rock formations, but no nasty surprises. The Allt Fender coming in from the left is spectacular but can be hard work to pass when it’s honking. Once you’re out of the gorge there’s just one more rapid to go: Sting in the Tail (Gd 4), sometimes called The Slot, is easily inspected from the right and is undercut on the left. It looks horrible but the line is surprisingly smooth – inspection often makes things worse! There are several big eddies on the right at the bottom – scramble up the bank and the path will lead you back to your car!</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allt Shallain flows into the west end of the Perthshire Loch Garry and is a high quality<br />river with almost 4km of continuous read and run grade 4 action. There are also a couple of classy looking grade 5 rapids which would probably go on the right day.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is one of those great rivers which is wide and open and could take all of the water in the entire galaxy. Make sure everything nearby is large and that it’s still raining. It’s not loch fed, so it’ll come up and drop off fast.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Pull off the A9 and park just off the main road at Dalnaspidal. From here you need to get yourself to the far end of Loch Garry, some 6.5km to the west. There is a good unsealed road beside the loch. Bikes, walking, paddling and space-hoppers represent just some of the potential forms of transport that you might choose. Once at the obvious bridge over the river, walk up on river left; it’s probably worthwhile going about 4km.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Spot the two grade 5 rapids as you make your way up the river, one below the bridge, and one in the bottom section of the river. The upper<br />grade 5 is one of the few places on the river with serious gradient and it’s also narrower; a series of tricky and powerful flumes stack up to make it long and hard. The bottom grade 5 is a high-volume rapid in a nice open setting with loads of good paddlestrokes required to avoid a big hole at the bottom. From wherever you put on, you’ll find yourself faced with excellent quality, medium volume, grade 4 which is mostly runnable with some careful eddy-<br />hopping. There may be some tricky features in the mix somewhere, so watch out! The river is generally not that steep, so it’s the volume and power which will provide the challenge, hence the need for plenty of water.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Only worth considering if you’re passing and the heavens have opened making boating elsewhere an intimidating prospect, this short section runs alongside, and can be glimpsed from, the A9. It can be scouted more fully from an abandoned bit of road which runs alongside the carriageway. You can pull off the A9 at NN 713 706 (56.8098, -4.1086).</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">During huge spates, copious amounts of water spill over the small dam on the Upper Garry and rush off downstream to form an utterly continuous shallow boulder run. Fast, furious and fun, watch out for a nasty bedrock rapid 800m below the dam, just after a footbridge. Make sure you can make an eddy and finish your run above this. At more moderate flows the river may still have something to offer, but the bedrock rapid at the end is no nicer,<br />ending in a pot-hole.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Perthshire Garry flows alongside the A9 from Drumochter summit. The section described is at Killiecrankie between Pitlochry and Blair Atholl. This river makes a pleasant trip through a scenic gorge with three harder sections, where the river becomes narrow and technical.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At lower flows the river is generally grade 1/2 with a couple of grade 3s and a portage. At high flows the speed of the river increases dramatically with violent boils coming off the sides of the gorge, making the trip at least a grade harder. The best place to gauge the flow is at the put-in. If the upstream rapid looks more than grade 3 the river is high.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the put-in from the north, turn off the A9 south of Blair Atholl and take the B8079 towards Killiecrankie. After about 2 miles, park where a small road crosses the river, taking care not to block access along this narrow road. Walk upstream on river left, past a dog-leg in the river. The put-in is 100m above this. To get to the take-out, carry on down the B8079. Turn right on the B8019 at Garry Bridge. There is ample parking in the council car park immediately after the bridge on the right-hand side. From the south, take the B8079 turning off the A9 just after Pitlochry. Continue until you reach the junction with the B8019 and the take-out.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The first rapid above the bridge can be inspected from the bank as you approach the put-in. This is followed by Dog Leg Falls, some 50m below the bridge, which can also be inspected before getting in. Although grade 3 at lower flows, this fall becomes quite chunky at high flows with a challenging approach, and warrants a grade of 4+. Below this fall, the river flattens but is still fast flowing as it leads down to the main constriction at Soldier’s Leap, some 500m below the bridge. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">It’s well worth checking this one out before getting on, particularly if you don’t know the river, as the drop is hard to spot from river level, and there are no eddies close above it. The constriction has been run, but at low flows the lead in is technical and there is a high pin poten-<br />tial. At high flows, the Leap begins to open up and is less technical (Gd 4+). Below the Leap, the gorge is a scenic grade 1/2 paddle. A metal footbridge crosses the river, about 200m above the take-out on river right, just before the road bridge. A short steep walk up the bank brings you to the car park. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent para-style-override-4">Beware of trees. A riverside path, that follows the run, is a popular tourist walk and there is a well laid out Visitors Centre beside the path near the put-in. The path crosses the river at the small iron bridge mentioned above,<br />coming out at the take-out on river right.<span></span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There is usually some compensation flow coming from the dam, but the run is only really worthwhile when the dam is releasing. Release information can be found on the SCA website. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Turn off the A9 towards Kinloch Rannoch. From Tummel Bridge continue up river left on the B846, for about 3 miles until you see the large dam. There is limited parking here beside the road. Scramble down the steep bank and then follow the track to put in immediately below the dam. The main drop (NN 732 592; 56.7072, -4.0728) can be inspected from the road, river left, on the way to the put-in, but you are on rocks about 10m above river level. To find the take-out, drive back down the road until the river is once more close to the road. There is a grade 3 rapid here, which can be inspected, but very limited parking. Alternatively there is a convenient car park just upstream of Tummel Bridge (400m above the last rapid).</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The first 1.5km provides some pleasant pool drop rapids at around grade 3. A few turns after you pass a large gatehouse on river left, watch out for the main drop of the river, Mclaren Falls. You will see a large rock outcrop – get out<br />river right to inspect or portage. This long rapid has a gnarly lead-in to a double-tier drop of about 3m, and lands in a grippy looking stopper closed in on both sides. Safety cover/rescue may be awkward. The river continues on at grade 2/3 until the road joins the river again. A last fun grade 3 chute, river left, marks a preferred take-out, or continue to Tummel Bridge on flat water for 2km. There is a small grade 2+ rapid just above the bridge. Below Tummel Bridge the river is flat but the volume is increased from the hydro out-take. You can continue into Loch Tummel and take out at several places onto the small road on the south side of the loch.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A major tributary of the Tay (at least it was before the hydro board kidnapped all the <br />water) the Tummel is crossed by the A9 near the picturesque town of Pitlochry. A nice short summer trip, it can be combined with a run on the Tay or rock climbing at nearby crags. During the summer months a regular dam release provides a runnable flow. The Tummel can also be run at other times of the year but like the Upper Spean can be hit or miss.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Summer dam releases or very wet weather are needed for this run. Look at the first rapid close to the road. If this can be run without scraping, then the level is fine. If the rapid is a ‘white-wash’ the river is high. At very high levels (when the outflow from the dam is about the height of the dam itself) the river is an incredible blast, though there are no eddies and plenty of enormous holes and tree hazards. The overall grade will be 3/4, and the Linn will be grade 5.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving north, take the right-hand turn-off the A9 towards Foss between the two junctions for Pitlochry. Follow this minor road and the river appears very soon, signposted the Linn of Tummel. Drive up and put in below the dam. There is limited parking at a small lay-by opposite the hydro-electric plant entrance. Walk down through the hydro-electric works via a small path branching right and following the fish ladder down to the river. Parking is no longer permitted on power station land at the take-out. There is parking above the Linn of Tummel, with a steep carry up from the river. Alternatively, get out 600m downstream of the power station,<br />on the north-east side of the loch. Reach this by driving along the road to the Faskally<br />Christian Trust and the Marine Scotland offices (NN918598; 56.7182, -3.7680). Parking is limited to five or so cars by the loch but there is plenty of parking further back in the woods. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>From the dam the river is easy grade 2 with the difficulty slowly increasing. The first grade 3 is Sawmill Falls, a long bouncy rapid with an awkward slot at the end. A few more straightforward rapids follow before a big flat section as the river passes under Coronation Bridge </span><span xml:lang="en-US">–</span><span> a white suspension bridge. After this comes a grade 3+ section. Constriction is first up, a tight turn into a narrow slot, with a large eddy on the right to grab any pieces if you’re quick. Straight up next is S bend, a technical rapid with an enormous pool at the bottom. Inspection and portaging is easy on the right. A few more grade 2/3 drops brings you to the Linn of </span><span>Tummel (Gd 4). A double stage fall, it’s easier than it looks. There is a ledge below the second drop on the left, visible when Loch Faskally is low, that should be avoided. Inspect/portage river right, though take note of the very slippery rocks! Rescue at the bottom is from the loch, so no stress there. The rocks on the left below the Linn give some great cliff jumping opportunities.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Please don’t overcrowd the lay-by at the put-in.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-1"><a id="Anchor-32" />Tay</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The main white water sections of the Tay are at Grandtully near Aberfeldy, and at Stanley just outside Perth. For touring or instructional<br />purposes it is best to look at an OS map to sort out a put-in and take-out. The river can be accessed easily for much of the way up the A9 and A827. The Tay offers plenty of year-round river activity for a variety of users, with playboating, competition, rafting and touring all occurring regularly. The river is the longest in Scotland and highest volume in the British Isles and can be paddled from source to firth. For those who aren’t into paddling too far, the playspots are easily accessed from the road.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Tay can be paddled all year round. Some of the playspots require certain water levels to be working well. The Tay@Pitnacree SEPA gauge will give an idea of current level.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the Grandtully rapid/slalom site, turn off the A9 at Ballinluig. Follow the A827 towards Aberfeldy, taking the right turn after you cross the river. About a mile after this bridge you reach Grandtully, turn left opposite the Inn on the Tay to reach the SCA campsite. Parking is free with a small charge for using the changing block or camping (with a discount for SCA members). See the SCA website for how to text ahead to get the access codes. Walk back down towards the Inn on the Tay to reach the slalom course section and take-out. A path on river right takes you to the slalom course put-in. This is the main white water section on the run so just carry back up for another go. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There is a dedicated SCA access point at Edradynate on the north bank of the river, a little over 2 miles above Grandtully rapid. Cross the bridge in Grandtully, turn left, and drive along the back road towards Weem until you see the SCA sign on a gate.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Alternatively, for a longer trip, it is also possible<br />to do the grade 1/2 trip down to Grandtully starting in Aberfeldy or even Kenmore. Turn right in Aberfeldy onto the B846 signposted to Weem and put in where the road crosses the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From Aberfeldy down, the Tay provides some grade 2 water, and some surfable waves. Grandtully offers slalom facilities over grade 3 water. There is a playhole that works at medium levels to the left of the centre rock at the start of the first small fall 200m below the put-in for the slalom site. A central rock just upstream of the bridge is the main hazard but can be avoided easily on either side. Below the bridge there is a small surf wave above a largish hole. The hole is powerful but allows blasts, etc. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Stanley section is a good all-round site, for beginners, race-heads and playboaters alike.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>Driving north from Perth on the A9, take the first turning, the B9099, for Stanley. After about 2 miles there is a car park on the left. This is the take-out at Thistlebrig. To avoid the strenuous carry up to the path at Thistlebrig, new take-out steps were built in 2016 at Luncarty, where the river comes closer to the road in the new housing estate. Turn off the main road just north of the primary school and access<br />to the river is from the first left cul-de-sac off Taypark Road. Funded by the Andy Jackson Fund for Access, using the proceeds from <br />previous editions of this guide and contributions from individuals and clubs, this is a good take-out for those who prefer a gentle float to carry-<br />ing their boat. To reach the put-in, continue<br />on into the village at Stanley. Turn right after the village green, then left at the T-junction. From here take the right turn onto Linn Road, which leads down to the river. Parking at the put-in can be a problem, the SCA currently pays for the gate to be open 1</span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US">st</span><span> May–31</span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US">st</span><span> August and 16</span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US">th</span><span> October–15</span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US">th</span><span> January as well as organising dustbins. Please pick up any litter, be responsible with shuttles and if possible use the car park in the village for shuttle vehicles. Updated information can be found on the SCA website.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Upstream from the put-in is Campsie Linn. The main river left chute on the Linn offers whirlpools and a large wave at certain levels, which starts to tube over when the river is high. At this level the whirlpools are powerful and can take boaters down for a whirley ride. The other chutes open up in higher water and can be a much friendlier alternative. Below the Linn is The Wall – a well defined deep eddy line for cartwheeling, cut-backs and other moves. About 500m downstream of the put-in is Stanley Weir. The centre chute is usually the best for playing. In high water, a large stopper may form below the weir, which should be treated with caution. At higher levels still, the whole weir is washed out, and a large green wave appears on the right. This wave has awesome potential for some great rides. From above the weir you can paddle back upstream to the car park, or continue on to Thistlebrig. Below the weir is grade 1/2 water, with one or two play-spots. Good waves lie just above an obvious right-hand bend, Hell Hole Corner, <span>if the river is up. In high water, a good surf wave forms on the far left of this corner, with a large eddy beside. The eddy service onto the wave is a little awkward, but the flat spins are worth it. Another wave also forms after this bend on river left. At most levels, you only get one shot here, although it is easy </span><span>enough to carry back up (river left) for another go. The next grade 2 rapid at the old mills contains an awesome catch-on-the-fly wave at medium levels. After a further 2km, large cliffs on the right mark the approach of the last rapid at Thistlebrig (Gd 2). There are various surf waves here depending on levels. Thistlebrig wave is big, bouncy and eddy serviced. It appears on river left when the Tay is around 3m on the SEPA gauge. Take out below on the right and follow the track uphill to the car park, or if the water is high, check out Wee Eric, the friendly wave/hole 200m downstream, river right. It runs between 2</span><span xml:lang="en-US">–</span><span>3m <a id="x.26648" />on the SEPA gauge, which is also a good level for the wave below Hell Hole Corner. At low levels Wee Eric has good eddy service, but as the level increases you will need to do a short carry and seal launch to get another ride. A further 2km of calm water brings you to an alternative take-out in Luncarty.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points<span></span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Stanley is possibly the most kayaked site in Scotland. Please be sensitive with access and share shuttles to avoid causing congestion. If there are any access problems, please contact the River Advisor or SCA office.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The weir is slowly falling apart and metal spikes may protrude. Generally these do not cause a problem, but the odd injury has occurred. At high levels, the whirlpools at Campsie Linn are very dangerous and should be treated with <br />respect. This is not a good place for a swim.</span><span></span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>A tributary of the River Lyon, the Keltney Burn drains from the much-trampled hill, Schiehallion. This is a great run, well worth the long walk</span><span xml:lang="en-US">-</span><span>in. With full-on drops and ledges, padded out with fast and interesting rapids and all in the back of beyond, this is a real mountain river.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">It will need to be going some to get this section running. At really big flows the trip is at its best. At more moderate flows it can be a bit scrapey between the falls and you would be better running the lower stretch. Check the level at the metal bridge by the Keltneyburn Hotel in Glen Lyon. The riverbed should be fully<br />covered, with no rocks showing below the bridge, if the upper stretch is to be runnable.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the Keltneyburn Hotel, drive north up the B846. The lower section is close to the road at this point but is hidden in a deep gorge.<br />After 4km you can park and access the river by Glengoulandie Lodges. This is the take-out for the Upper Keltney, and also the put-in for the lower section. To get to the upper put-in<br />continue on the B846, turning left at the minor<br />road marked Schiehallion Road. After 4km the Braes of Foss parking area used for access to Schiehallion is reached on the left (NN 753 557; 56.6766, -4.0368<span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">)</span>. Try not to be put off by the strange looks from the hillwalkers as you unload the boats, several miles from the nearest body of water. Initially you follow the main Schiehallion path past the forest and onto the open moor. After 500m, turn left and follow the remains of the old track that contours around the hill. After 2km, the track peters out. Continue to contour round the hill, aiming for the flattening in the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Fast and shallow rapids begin almost straight away. A 2m ledge, which requires inspection, comes up quickly and serves as a good warning for its bigger brother not far below. This 5m fall is just off vertical, and it’s quite a challenge to make the boof and avoid the strong towback (Gd 5). If you choose to portage, this can be done at river level on the left, though you do have to fight your way round a rocky point and risk being sucked back into the hole you were trying to avoid! At high flows, the gorge after the fall is really good grade 4 fun. You now find yourself being flushed along more open water with several mini-gorges concealing grade 4/5 water. A straight stretch of grade 3/4 water tries to lure you into the lower gorge. Don’t let it! As soon as you spot the river banks beginning to steepen, you should climb out on river left. Beyond here a couple more runnable drops and a fence blocking the river lead to a major unrunnable cataract dividing the upper and lower sections. This is not going to be very nice at the kind of flows that make the upper river paddleable. You could continue to the lip of this monster, but it will be harder to get out of the gorge and the drops on the run<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>in look hard to scout from river level. It<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s a 1km walk on river left down the hill and through the deer park to the road.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">You are way out there on this one, so take enough gear and some spare clothes/food. It might be worth taking a map and compass if the weather is really grotty. Please take care not to damage the fences at the deer park as you walk out. Trees are likely to be a hazard on this section.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The lower section of the Keltney Burn is a steep and technical run in a narrow gorge,<br />requiring a portage round some high (unrunnable?) falls: a fun excursion, but not of the same quality as the upper section.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">As the section runs in a narrow gorge, it comes into condition regularly and would probably be too exciting in full flood! Check the level at the metal bridge by the Keltneyburn Hotel in Glen Lyon. The small fall immediately upstream of the bridge should look entertaining for the gorge to be worthwhile. If the river is covering all the rocks below the bridge the upper section would be a better bet.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The metal bridge by the Keltneyburn Hotel makes a good take-out. To find the put-in,<br />follow the description to reach the take-out for the upper section.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Initially the river winds its way through the narrow gorge with the odd grade 4 ledge. Trees are likely to be a hazard on this section. Halfway through the run there is a twisting fall into a narrow and grippy hole (Gd 5). Easy water and a tree blockage signals the approach of the Falls of Keltney. The first of these high falls is easily runnable, but how to get out of the pothole before the next drop is less obvious. Portaging the falls on river right you can get to the car quickly by continuing on the forest road, but it’s worth making the effort to lower back into the gorge below the falls and complete the trip. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Lyon drains part of Rannoch Moor, bet-<br />ween Loch Rannoch and Loch Tay. The large catchment area provides a good volume run that holds its water really well. The main white water section is through a bizarre gorge full of weird features, with the forest occasionally providing a leafy canopy.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Lyon is heavily affected by various dams in its upper reaches and you are normally left with a reliable but measly compensation flow. The release on the River Lyon arrives at this section on the following day. It is runnable in the morning but better in the afternoon. Check the Lyon@Comrie Bridge SEPA gauge and the SCA website for releases. The bridge at the take-out can be used as a physical gauge. If the water is covering the concrete, the river is running high. If the water is <span xml:lang="en-US">15cm</span> below the concrete, the river is still OK.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the A9 take the A827 to Aberfeldy. Turn right in the town onto the B846, cross the Tay and continue until you reach Keltneyburn. Take the left turn here, signposted to Glen Lyon. After about 3 miles, just after Fortingall (famous for its ancient yew tree), the road splits. The left fork leads down to a bridge over the Lyon – this is the take-out. To reach the put-in return to where the road forks. Turn left up the glen and continue for about 3 miles to where the river levels out again and a track leads down to a footbridge. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river runs through a variety of weird little gorges for the first 2km. The first rapid in the first gorge changed in 2017; there is now a boulder blocking the previously clean line on river right and siphon on river left. There is still a gap you can get through, but it’s super narrow and would likely form a sticky hole in higher water. It can be run at about grade 4+, but there’s not a good angle to inspect it from and you can’t get back into the gorge when you portage it. After another tight slot, which is passable with care, and one or two fun playspots, the rapids get more continuous until you find a series of drops ending in a constriction. Although it does get run, at almost all levels this constriction is very dangerous and merits a portage. Make sure that you have noted a suitable eddy well above this spot before you get on the river. After this, the river eases off until one final 1m drop, which forms a large pour-over in high water; this is run down either edge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Watch out for siphons and undercuts. An advanced group should be able to cope, but this run is now useless as an intermediate club trip. Below Fortingall to Green Bridge (at the Tay confluence) is a classic grade 2+ run with a couple of grade 3 ledges.</p>

The bottom half contains larger drops, which are best inspected on the walk up. The run doesn’t want too much water, but the flow is diminished by a hydro scheme, so it will need to have been wet to bring this run into condition.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The burn at Innerwick is less steep than the Invervar and runs through a more open glen. The top half has a constant gradient providing grade 3/4 paddling. The river then drops into a gorge where it becomes a little more serious with small slabby falls. The crux is a logslide off a 2m ledge to avoid rocks.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Lochay flows into the west end of Loch Tay, near the village of Killin. The River Lochay is a medium volume river in a quiet and unspoiled glen. It can be thought of as a mini River Orchy, with long flat stretches separated by bedrock rapids and falls.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This river requires a fair amount of water to be worthwhile, especially in its upper reaches, which would feel bony in anything other than a reasonable flow. The river runs close to the road. Make sure that you check the level above the out-flow from the power station, about 4km up the glen. Even if the river is a little bony to run the whole section, expert kayakers may derive some amusement by running the Falls of Lochay. For the whole trip to be on, as a rough guide, 0.8 on the SEPA gauge for the Dochart could probably be considered a minimum flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From Killin, drive north on the A827. Take<br />either of the two minor roads that lead up Glen Lochay. For the full trip, drive to the head of the glen and put in near Kenknock. The road bridge just downstream of the power station outflow makes a good take-out.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the put-in, you are into good rapids straight away. A slightly shallow 3m fall gives the trip a kick start. After 1km or so, the rapids ease and there is a long stretch of flat water. The next set of rapids start way too far downstream, so be prepared for a long paddle or a quick shuttle by car. The river continues with more dead water and the odd entertaining grade 4 ledge. The best is saved till last in the form of the Falls of Lochay, which lie behind the power station. Best scouted from river right, these five drops form an impressive cascade, quite pushy in a high flow (Gd 5).</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At the right level, this is a good run that deserves to be more popular. It twins well with a trip to the Falls of Dochart, although both may not be up together on the same day.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The River Dochart flows through the charming highland village of Killin, at the west end of Loch Tay. The falls themselves flow right past the door of the Clachaig Hotel, a great place for a celebratory drink, or a stiff whisky to calm the nerves. This is touristville, so in the summer be prepared to boat with an audience. For the white<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>water paddler, this truly is a one hit wonder, but if you’re in the area with the right water level, it’s worth getting on.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This stretch requires medium to high flows. Due to its long flat upper reaches, the river is slow to come up but holds its water well, and may be worth visiting even a day or two after heavy rain. A quick look over the bridge in Killin<br />will tell you all you need to know. At 0.7 or less on the Dochart@Killin SEPA gauge, it will be a bit scrapey under the bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Either walk up the road with your boat and put in just upstream of Killin, or for a warm<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>up, drive west on the A827 for about a mile (NN 562 316; 56.4554, -4.3348). There is a ‘lay-by’ on the right, near where the river comes close to the road. Take out at the end of the white water on river right. A good path leads back upstream to the village. Do not be tempted to stray into Loch Tay, as it’s about 1.5km of flat-water paddling to the next take-out.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At medium/high flows, this is a great fun rapid. The usual line follows the main flow to the right of the top island and on through the left-hand bridge arch. This is the crux of the run, and is best inspected before you get on. The menacing hole under the bridge is normally avoided on the left. Watch out for fishermen in the eddy on river left. The action doesn’t end quite here, and the rapid continues below the bridge. There is a ledge some 200m downstream which can form a retentive hole. At high flows the whole stretch should probably be considered a grade 5, and a powerful one at that.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To scout the rapid under the bridge you can ask for a key from the Tourist Information Centre.<span xml:lang="en-US"> </span>Above the falls, the Dochart has good potential for an easy touring trip. Keep an eye out for the Lix Toll rapids some 3km above<br />Killin, which make a long grade 3 when there is enough water, and don’t forget to take out in good time before the falls.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This burn begins life behind the outdoor centre<br />on the south side of Loch Tay. It twins well with the Newton Burn if you’re up for a walk.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If the central rock in the falls at the road bridge over the Ardeonaig Burn is not visible, and it is still raining, you should be in luck.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Go along the south of Loch Tay towards Ardeonaig, where you take a turn away from the loch towards the outdoor centre. If you ask in the office at Ardeonaig Abernethy Outdoor Centre they may be happy for you to leave your car tucked away. Then you commit to the walk to the get-in, which is along the Rob Roy Way to start with. After crossing the Newton Burn, veer left and follow the stream up until a pipeline crosses the river. For the take-out, eddy left just above a wire fence across the river,<br />immediately below the confluence with the Newton Burn. Walk up the bank and follow the track back to the car.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This river has a little bit of everything. The first half starts by going through a tunnel under the track, and is followed by little falls, slides and drops. The river moves fast and scouting is often best done on the walk-in over the heather. There is a slightly larger rocky fall into a pool which marks the halfway point as the river changes character instantly. This is also an alternative get-in if you’ve had enough of walking or don’t like the look of the upper section. From here down is 1.5km of continuous white water with a couple of steeper rapids, before you come around the final bend and see the egress eddy 100m ahead of you.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Be aware of two fences. The river has all been paddled on a few occasions and is a blast. From below the get-out, it contains some more nice slides and drops but landslides and tree blockages have made it currently unnavigable.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the Ardeonaig Outdoor Centre, the walk to the put-in starts along the Rob Roy Way. Cross the Newton Burn, then follow it until you decide to get in.

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This stream is a continuous piece of white<br />water of fairly even gradient, and is a fast<br />cannonball ride with the exception of the main falls. These appear just after the bridge over the river and are easily visible on the walk-in. This double drop hasn’t had a descent yet; there is a boulder blocking most of the river at the halfway stage. Make sure to scout. Continue on down to the egress.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Urlar Burn runs right through the Tayside village of Aberfeldy. The Urlar is a long roller<span xml:lang="en-US">-<br /></span>coaster run, with very little chance to wave to the tourists in Aberfeldy as you pass. At a good level, it is just one long rapid.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Look over the bridge in Aberfeldy. If the river is flowing hard and all the rocks are covered, it should be a really good run.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This river has excellent bedrock slides and boulder rapids with all the holes, rocks and pour-overs you’d expect. Watch out for a narrow notch (maybe get in below this?), low bridges and trees. There are three good drops in the vicinity of the car park, which make the crux of the run and are worth a look.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Braan flows into the Tay near Dunkeld in central Perthshire. It has three distinct sections depending on the amount of rain around and how challenged you wish to feel. The upper section is a very continuous, alpine style grade 3/3+ blast with enough water. It is usually combined with the middle Braan on a rainy weekend.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A reading of 0.9 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum level. This section is continuous grade 4 in flood levels.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Turn off the A9 at Dunkeld and follow the A822. Put in at Amulree. There are lay-bys either side of the road by the old hotel with plenty of room for cars. Easy access to the river is found between the old and new bridges. You can take out at the bridge by Dullator Farm sign-<br />posted Little Fingowie. There is some parking here, but be careful not to block the farm road.<br />Generally, continuing down to Meikle Findowie<br />Farm, where a metal bridge crosses over the river, is easiest. To find the bridge, turn off the A822 about a mile upstream of the point where the A822 crosses the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river starts flat and scenic at Amulree and gently warms up to continuous grade 3+ bouldery rapids. Eddies are small and trees line the bank, so keep your wits about you! You may need to portage the low bridge at NN 919 378 if the river is very high, though since the river flattens out here, it may be best just to walk to the road and finish your trip. Alternatively carry<br />on down to one of the take-outs described above.  A long float, this stretch provides an easier alternative for the faint-hearted when the river is in flood. It has little of interest for white water junkies, but leads nicely into the middle section and, as the gradient is constant, in high water you’ll cover ground faster than you expect!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a fun trip which picks up pace as it goes, culminating in the awesome but unrunnable cascade at Rumbling Bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a river that rises and falls quickly and needs a good flow to be runnable. A reading of 0.9 on the Braan@Hermitage SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Put in at the end of the upper section, or at Amulree for the full trip. There is a convenient take-out at a stone bridge about a mile upstream of the Rumbling Bridge; however parking is very limited. It is better to take out at a lay-by on the A822, around ½ mile above the falls (NN 989 405; 56.5461, -3.6445). More experienced paddlers could take out above Rumbling Bridge, or portage round river right to continue down the gorge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The first drop is on a sharp bend to the right. The next drop (Gd 3+/4) is easily recognised by the ominous horizon line. Inspection is difficult, involving cliff scrambling on the right, and you’ll need to go a long way to see all of the holes you might end up in, but you can boat scout the left line from some small eddies in low<span xml:lang="en-US">/</span>medium water. There are other lines in the centre and on the right, divided by rocky ledges that become big holes with more water. These lines can be very tight, with long surfs in the munchy holes for those who drift off.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>Now you’re into the gorge </span><span>proper. There are a few more grade 3 drops, rising to 4 in high water, with the biggest under the bridge. Eddy-<br />hopping is usually the best strategy. Watch out for a tricky hole just after the bridge! A big eddy here is handy for picking up the pieces. Don’t relax too soon as the last rapid (Gd 3+) is just round the next corner, a long boulder garden with some big waves. The bottom of this rapid often has fallen trees in the eddies, which can make rescues a bit tricky. Below here the river eases to grade 1/2 and the first take-out is reached. Easy water and the second take-out follow before the approach to Rumbling Bridge. If you like your rapids very scary, there is a grade 5 just above Rumbling </span><span xml:lang="en-US">B</span><span>ridge, though if you miss your line, you </span><span xml:lang="en-US">had </span><span>better hope your safety crew know what they’re doing! The first drop of the run-in goes on the left at grade 4+. However a big hole can form at high water and this would be a very bad place to be out of control. There is very little time from here to make the last take-out on river right.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Just before joining the River Tay at Dunkeld, the River Braan cascades over the waterfall at Rumbling Bridge and drops into an impressive and scenic gorge. Christened the ‘Mad Mile’, the gorge section is fast, continuous and exciting when high. At a lower level, the run is more bouldery and reaching the river may prove to be the biggest challenge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This river tends to go up and down very<br />quickly, often within half a day. The gorge is at its best when high, giving a continuous and quite pushy run. Looking from Rumbling Bridge, if there is not a clear eddy where you climb down, expect a fast ride! The SEPA gauge station is located at the take-out in the<br />Hermitage car park, so you can look online or at the gauge itself. A reading of 0.7<span xml:lang="en-US">–</span>1 is low/medium and 1.1+ is high. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the put-in, turn off the A9 onto the A822 at Dunkeld. After 2 miles turn off right for Rumbling Bridge. There is a car park immediately on the right and it’s a short walk to Rumbling Bridge. After gawking at the fall you can gain the river lowering boats down an awkward muddy gully on river right 20m below the bridge. Take out at the Hermitage car park, signposted off the A9 just north of Dunkeld and the A822 turning. If you have only one car you may find it easiest to walk/run the shuttle via the woodland path on river left. Alternatively, it is possible to extend the trip by continuing down to the main A9 bridge or on into Dunkeld itself.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At a high flow the excitement starts immediately with continuous grade 4 for the first kilometre, a real cracking stretch. Rapids follow in quick succession; this is not a good place to swim, especially if the river is high. Towards the end of this section, a left-hand bend, a big eddy and a tree in the river mark the approach to Splitter (Gd 5). Best scouted from the left, this rapid is blocked by a huge central boulder. The left-hand channel has a nasty pothole, which is not recommended especially at low/medium flows. Much of the best action is in this short top section and, for those who’ve had enough excitement, it’s possible to carry back up the left bank to the car. The next major rapid is The Coffin (Gd 5+), a river-wide ledge with a very nasty tow-back at high flows. From here, there are a couple of grade 3/4 rapids before Hermitage Falls (Gd 5+), which is portaged on the left. Easy water then leads down to the take-out at the Hermitage car park. The section from here to Dunkeld is grade 2/3 when the river is high. It includes a good site for slalom training behind the Forestry Commission Offices.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Be sure to take out well above Hermitage Falls! These falls have had several descents at a <br />ariety of levels, but come with their own health warning. The river can often become tree choked especially higher up. </p>

			<p class="Section-heading">Eastern Promise</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Under this chapter we have included the rivers<br />of the Angus Glens as well as those runs which drain the eastern Cairngorms and form the mighty River Dee. The former includes such classics as the West Water and the North Esk, which provide high quality and generally<br />dependable grade 3 and 4 paddling for much of the year. By contrast the creeks in the upper reaches of the Dee and Muick offer challenging spate trips up to grade 5. The Lui, Quoich and Garbh Allt compare favourably with many of the classic steep runs of the west. Although heavy rain or snowmelt is required to bring them up, many of them rapidly become very difficult or unrunnable with too much water<span xml:lang="en-US">, while t</span>here are some that can take as much water as you can throw at them. As for the Melgan; well that’s in a world of its own! For the playboaters, there are several excellent waves on the River Don, when it’s in spate. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>Although this area does not see as much rain as other parts of Scotland, </span><span xml:lang="en-US">a </span><span>significant amount of snow fall</span><span xml:lang="en-US">s</span><span> and accumulate</span><span xml:lang="en-US">s</span><span> in the high cold inland areas, and the melt in the spring is often a little later and more sustained than that on the west coast. The rivers of the east are generally longer with larger, easier angled catchments. As a result, the rivers will often stay up for a day or two after the run-off has finished on the west of the country. Given the dominant weather<br />pattern in Scotland, of unsettled weather sweeping in from the south-west, you can use this to your advantage. You can often enjoy the rivers on the west coast, which see the rain first and are quick to rise on one day, and by a short drive, catch the runs on the east the next.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>Part of the Mar Lodge </span><span xml:lang="en-US">E</span><span>state owned by the Nat-<br />ional Trust for Scotland, the Lui runs through an area of natural beauty, entering the River Dee near to the village of Braemar. This is a short, slabby bedrock run with an inspiring cascade. It is set in a beautiful and easily accessible, yet reasonably secluded, part of a popular glen.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Not having a loch to feed it, and being <span xml:lang="en-US">only </span>small itself, the Lui takes its time to come up, but drops faster than a stone. If the ground is wet, a couple of night’s rain will bring the river up to a paddleable if low level. Snow melt or heavy rain in the eastern Cairngorms is needed to get it running well. As a minimum, the slabs closest to the track end should be reasonably well covered.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From Braemar, follow the Linn of Dee road. About 400m past the Linn of Dee car park, the Lui appears. Park beside the river, but be careful not to obstruct the locked gate on the left, which is used by the mountain rescue team. This is the take-out. Walk up either side of the river for about a kilometre until an obvious flattening. If the road is busy it’s best to use the Linn of Dee car park. From here, follow the Derry Lodge track then cut down to the river and continue upstream.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There’s fun to be had from the outset, with the Lui splitting around a small island and running over smooth pink slabs. This is followed by an excellent cascade falling about 5m over 30m, complete with obstacles, and ending in a freestyle-freefall drop into a hole. The chances are you’ll almost have recovered by the time you reach the next highlight, but you can always get your breath back as you check it for wood. This is a must, as the situation changes often. If there’s no blockage, a great line exists river left, down a slab into a slot and, quite often, around and around in the slot. At medium to low levels you can stand close enough to the hole to catch your saucer-eyed pals as they return for the rinse cycle! An Aberdeen Uni Magic<br />Bat once spent two weeks in there, somewhere. The rest of the run to the road bridge is made up of easy<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>angled fun slabs. For those who want to go further there<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s one more small rapid before the river bumbles into the Dee.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Quoich is located in the Cairngorms close to Braemar, but on the opposite side of the Dee. The Quoich is a short, scary-fun run in a beautiful place. It<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s all bedrock pool-drop, characterised by unusual narrow slots. Rapids<br />can be inspected and protected from the<br />safety of the bank or easily walked around.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This run needs substantial snow melt or heavy rain in the eastern Cairngorms to bring it into condition. It has similar requirements to the Lui, but is better with a drop more water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Cross the Lui and continue on to the car park at the road end, close to the Linn of Quoich. From here, walk up the track which starts just before the road bridge all the way to the put-in or, if you want to see what you’re letting yourself in for, follow the riverside footpath. Cross the bridge over the Linn and follow the track until it reaches a floodplain.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A small rapid about 100m upstream of the obvious first fall is your only warm up. The fall itself is a 3-4m drop into a deep slot and fluffy hole – a great swimming pool on a hot day if the river’s too low to paddle! Check for wood. Downstream lies a beautiful ledge drop into what can be, at high levels, a really sticky hole. A two-man team once had a scary ‘this is how not to do it’ time on this drop. While Al Collis threw ends and ‘recirced’ in the hole not breathing, his safety was too busy trying not to fall in to be of any help!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Next up, the Punch Bowl was named for the textbook pothole, set in smooth slabs on river right, nicely away from the line. This is followed by the Linn of Quoich, an amazing slot less than a metre wide. The tempting wee gorge that follows contains a well-hidden undercut after a small drop with a slab on its right. Get out, river right, and scramble round to locate the undercut just downstream. Dave Kwant once spent around 30 seconds under this, before finally managing to pull himself out. The boat stayed there another two days. You have been warned! Depending on the water level this undercut may be passable, but please take care or just get off after the Linn and carry<br />(river left) round the last gorge. After the gorge it’s an easy bimble back to the car park.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river supplies the nearby house, so please be considerate. There is great wild camping in the area, but it is quite a popular spot with walkers and picnickers.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The action on the Clunie can be seen from the road bridge in Braemar, or closer up by scrambling down the path beside the hotel. The latter option puts you in a great position to see your mate’s face as they swim out of the bottom hole! Some steps on river right bring you to a path that takes you back up to the road. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Funnily enough, the Callater is in Glen Callater, which joins the A93 (Glen Shee road) about 2 miles south of Braemar. The Callater Burn is a big-spate classic. It’s got the characteristic of Scotch Broth, albeit in quite a small bowl! Open moorland, wide boulder bounces and bedrock drops, slots and slabs, and a stunning wee gorge to leave a sweet taste.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This run is a good option if other rivers are too high, as it can handle nearly unlimited amounts of rain. It runs high as you like, but not low: the river bed is used for gorge walking most of the year! Loch-fed, it doesn’t rise or fall as quickly as some of the other rivers in the area. The gorge can still be entertaining even when the rest of the run is a scrape. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the lay-by, look at the last eddy before the deer fence (under the bridge). Is there any shingle showing? Can you see any rocks in the last corner of the gorge? If the answer to either of these is yes, it’s too low. If the river’s churning brown and you’re unsure whether you’ll make it to the bank before the deer fence, then the level’s right. You can gauge the level for yourself as you walk up the burn. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The take-out is found about 2 miles south of Braemar on the A93, Glen Shee road. This is a popular spot with walkers, an alternative footpath to Lochnagar, so there may be a few cars in the lay-by. The track beside the river is important for ghillies and mountain rescue, so leave room in the lay-by for their Land<span xml:lang="en-US"> R</span>overs. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the put-in, carry up the track for about 2km. Nearly all of the river can be seen <span xml:lang="en-US">while </span>walking in. When your body feels like giving up, you’re almost halfway! Carry on till the footbridge; there’s nothing great upstream of here. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Depending on your group, and the water level,<br />the Callater is all read and run. There are no big waterfalls or nasty surprises, just great quality rapids. However, the eddies are small and chase boating is frantic. The hardest rapid, with a greedy hole, is a few hundred metres upstream of the gorge – worth protecting as a swim from here could be long and bumpy. The entrance to the gorge is a classic roller coaster run, while the gorge itself is surprisingly straightforward. Complacency though, is often rewarded by a scramble for the last eddy above the deer fence, as your group gets spat out of the gorge just metres upstream of the take-out bridge. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If you wish to extend the trip as far as Braemar<br />there are obvious shuttle implications and concerns about getting round the deer fence under the bridge. Sometimes it is possible to get around it, but please take great care to do no damage. The alternatives all involve fences, so check out your options and be aware of the residents of Auchallater House. The Callater is a water supply for the house, so please take relevant care. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A classic Deeside burn, the Garbh Allt flows into the Dee some 4 miles east of Braemar. This is a short but intense run with beautiful river features – most notably smooth pink granite slabs. The slabby sections are separated by bouldery bits, which in high water become challenging in themselves. You never stop feeling <span xml:lang="en-US">as if </span>you’re going downhill until you reach your car. The Falls of Garbh Allt were reputedly Queen Victoria’s favourite waterfall; a cast iron bridge was erected to give her a better view of this eye-pleasing cascade. With its setting in an old pine forest, this small mountain burn is today still as eye catching as ever.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Serious rain or snow melt from Lochnagar is needed for this one. Get it too high and it’s scary, with a probable portage. Too low and you could scrape down the slabs but not paddle between them. The burn rises very quickly once the ground is wet. Cross the suspension bridge over the River Dee and follow the track. Look upstream at the first bridge (with a deer fence under it). The shingle on the river right fork should be covered well enough to scrape/float out, and there should be water coming in from a fork on river left – it probably won’t look like enough water, but that’s okay.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The run is accessed from North Deeside road, about 4 miles east of Braemar and 1 mile east of the obvious Invercauld Bridge. It is hard to see the river from the road, so look out for a white suspension footbridge with a very small area to pull in. This is the take-out. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the put-in, carry over the footbridge or paddle over the Dee underneath it, then turn right along a Land<span xml:lang="en-US"> R</span>over track. Follow this over a low track bridge and take a left. Keep going uphill (always a good sign!) ignoring rights and lefts until you see a small footbridge high above a rapid. Cross the bridge and follow the path even further uphill to a cast iron bridge over some enticing granite slabs. Put in just upstream, or carry a bit further and do the slabs you can see – the ones that end in the perfect hole above waterfalls!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Some of the classiest action is metres from the put-in, with smooth bedrock slabs into a great deep plunge pool. This is the highest fall on the run, which leaves no time for a warm-up or psyche-up. It is, though, fluffier than it looks – and with such a scenic back-drop you’ll need to do it twice for the cameras! Once you leave the comfort of the pool, you’re into the run proper and need to be alert. Boulders feed quickly into slabs with only tiny eddies for inspecting and, depending on the water height, some pretty chunky holes craftily scattered. Everything is generally read and run, but it’s worth checking the rapid you walked over on the way up, under the footbridge. In the centre is a well-shaped broaching rock, and at very high levels a hole that you’ll be glad to swim out of! Once through, it’s back to read and run until you see the shingle beds and the bridge carrying the Land<span xml:lang="en-US"> R</span>over track near the take-out. Remember there’s a deer fence under the bridge, and the gathering eddy is quite small.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Although on the Balmoral Estate and so part of the royal back yard, access has never been a problem. Don’t be offended if men with dark glasses and Inspector Gadget coats ask what you’re up to when the Queen’s in residence.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Situated in Royal Deeside close to the famous crags of Lochnagar, the Muick is a fast, bouncy grade 3 boulder trip, divided into 2 sections by the impressive Linn of Muick.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Unless it’s brown and churning, this river will feel like a rocky ditch. More ballsy than technical, the 10m falls can be paddled at low flows, when the rest would not be worth contemplating.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Take the B976 from Ballater towards Braemar. After less than a mile, at Bridge of Muick, turn off upstream. After about 1½ miles, a road leads down to the take-out bridge. To reach the put-in, return to the road up the glen, and continue on for another 3 miles to the next bridge. Find a lay-by in the section above the bridge and carry down to the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Starting off open, as the river flows under the first bridge the gradient increases slightly, giving fast continuous grade 3+ water with the odd good ‘catch it if you can’ wave. This is read and run territory, crashing through waves and avoiding small pour-overs, making up the line as you go. The Linn of Muick comes up less than a kilometre after the bridge. Make sure you take out in plenty of time. This would not be a good one to do by accident! Below the falls, there is more of the same, although the features are slightly more broken with fewer surfable waves.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Linn itself comprises a 4m ramp into a messy lip with a boulder on the right. At low flows this may cause damage while at high flows it produces a rooster tail kicking onto rocks. The ramp should be run pointing left to avoid this. The lip is ill defined, particularly at high flows, where it is almost impossible to get a boof in. People have hit the bottom at fairly high flows and flat landings at low flow hurt. </p>

It’s a reasonably large river and relatively straightforward for much of its length. There is some white water in the last kilometre at Bridge of Gairn, before the confluence with the Dee.

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Dee is the main river basin draining the southern Cairngorms. It flows eastwards, entering the North Sea in Aberdeen. From source to sea, this is a fine touring river with good interest and scenery throughout. Access points are available at regular intervals along the<br />river; these are fully described in the Scottish Canoe Touring guide. Most of the way the water is grade 2 above Banchory, and grade 1 below, although there are occasional entertaining rapids. Those at Invercauld Bridge, Dinnet Bridge, Pota<span xml:lang="en-US">r</span>ch Bridge, Cairnton and Invercanny are all grade 3. The two best white water sections are described here. Both have some play potential at most levels.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The top section is most fun at very high flows and is a good alternative in spate conditions when the other Deeside burns have become too scary.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">For the top section head out of Braemar on the Linn of Dee road. The take-out at Victoria Bridge is reached after about 3 miles. To get to the put-in continue up the road and park by the bridge over the Linn of Dee. If there isn<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>t much space here, you can unload the boats and then continue on to the nearby Forestry Commission car park. Walk down to the river and put in below the Linn.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At very high water the section from below the Linn of Dee has some good potential. The rapids<br />are straightforward but powerful, flushing<br />together in the upper reaches. In these conditions, there are some large relatively friendly stoppers behind Muir Cottage, which provide an entertaining finish to the trip. At lower flows there<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s more time to collect the pieces between the rapids.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">You can nearly always get down the Dee, so it’s a good summer river when there’s nothing else, but the different rapids all come into condition at different levels.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">For this, the most commonly paddled section, head out of Aberdeen on the A93. The put-in is beside the obvious bridge in Potarch. To reach the take-out, return on the A93 toward<br />Aberdeen. Turn right at the traffic lights in Banchory and park in the public car park. For those who like to park and play, you can access the river at Invercannie waterworks. Please contact the Local Access Advisor to get information on the current access situation here.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The section from Potarch to Banchory is regularly paddled and gives continuous grade 2 water. There are two harder rapids at Cairnton and Invercannie, both with good waves to surf at some levels. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is one of Scotland’s prime salmon fishing rivers. Relationships with the fishermen are generally excellent. Please contact the Local Access Adviser, through the SCA office or website for up to date information. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a bit of a one-hit wonder, but it’s fairly entertaining on a wet day, especially for those who enjoy playing to a crowd.

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A well-kept secret among the local clubs in and around Aberdeen, the Don lazily meanders from the Eastern Cairngorms with little to note, other than a few old weirs, until it reaches Aberdeen, where it finally starts to pick up. Unsurprisingly, this being an urban run, the section is defined by man-made weirs with flat sections in between. However, these can provide entertaining rapids, especially at higher flows!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This section can be paddled at any level, with rapids becoming more of a challenge in higher<br />water. If the river looks calm and the water line is a couple of feet lower than the bank the river will be low. If the river is bank full and flowing quickly with some boils it will<span xml:lang="en-US"> be</span> high to huge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Using the Parkhill gauge on the SEPA website: Scrape – 0.9<span xml:lang="en-US">–</span>1, Low – 1<span xml:lang="en-US">–</span>1.2, Medium – 1.2<span xml:lang="en-US">–</span>1.5, High – 1.5<span xml:lang="en-US">–</span>1.8, Huge – &gt;1.8.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Entering Aberdeen from the south, follow the A90 through the city until you join the A96 at the Haudagain roundabout. Follow the signposts for Dyce (A947) then carry on this road for around 1½ miles. Just before the BP office<br />is a right-hand turn. The put-in is at the<br />end of this road, after a short walk down the riverside footpath. With the closure of several offices parking is no issue currently. There are two commonly used take-outs, one at <span xml:lang="en-US">the </span>Bannatyne gym at Danestone and one in Seaton Park further downstream. The gym has an agreement with paddlers to use the corner of their car park furthest from the building if it is quiet. Consider using the Seaton Park take-out if the gym looks busy.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At the put-in the river is calm and slow-<br />moving, allowing for a relaxing warm<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>up before<br />the first weir. This is tucked around the first left-hand bend, a couple of hundred metres downstream. Both hard left and hard right go nicely and those looking for an extra challenge might want to tackle the fish ladder, right of centre. From there, it is only a short distance to the Mill <span xml:lang="en-US">R</span>apid (Gd 3+), which begins just after the next corner – inspect river left. The top of this rapid consists of a broken weir which should be taken river left; river right has several metal spikes in it which are only obvious in low water. Push river right after the weir <span xml:lang="en-US">(</span>to avoid the rocks in low water or <span xml:lang="en-US">the </span>surprisingly retentive holes that form when the river is high<span xml:lang="en-US">)</span> and enjoy the remainder of the rapid! Please note, above 2 on the SEPA gauge expect this rapid to be a full-on grade 4 with some big waves and holes. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river eases off again with a couple of easy shingle rapids while the scenery does its best to make you forget you’re in a city. A large pipe arching over the river notifies you of your<br />imminent approach to the other main rapid on the river, the Double Weir (Gd 3/3+). Inspecting river left is advisable as the first of the two weirs has started to collapse due to flooding in early 2016 and while there is no dangerous debris or metalwork currently in the rapid it could change in the future. At the bottom of the second weir a fun low-water playwave can form. This is also the location of an extreme high-water wave (above 2 on the gauge) nicknamed Hawaii-sur-Don by some former Aberdeen University students, although this may have changed with the first weir collapsing.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent para-style-override-4">A couple more minor rapids and a flat section leads you under a road bridge and onto the last rapid – take the left of centre line between two islands. The take-out at Bannatyne<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s gym is river left at the end of this rapid. If you opted for the lower take-out carry on; the next rapid is a broken weir which is best taken left of centre. At levels above 1.8 on the gauge, a great playwave with eddy access forms on river right here, which only gets better with more water. Continuing downstream is more sedate from now on, just remember to avoid the hard-right channel when the river splits around several islands<span xml:lang="en-US">;</span> it leads to a community hydro scheme! Ending at Seaton Park, you can take out at the slalom site river right or run the last weir to shorten your walk to the car.<span></span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-1"><a id="Anchor-58" />North Esk</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The North Esk runs through Angus, halfway between Aberdeen and Dundee. It<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s in an attractive area, much loved and visited by Queen Victoria. The river itself is one of many that drain eastwards from the great Mounth plateau of the South-East Grampians. It starts life at the bottom of Glen Mark and weaves its way through the rounded foothills of the Angus Glens before heading across the Vale of Strathmore to Montrose Bay. The North Esk runs through a glen that is quiet and sleepy, except on rainy Wednesdays when the local universities invade! It is possible to navigate<br />the river from its source in Loch Lee all the way to the sea<span xml:lang="en-US">;</span> however after Gannoc<span xml:lang="en-US">h</span>y Bridge the river is flat with some grade 2 and the occasional weir. As such it offers little for the white<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>water boater. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There are two main white water sections. The popular lower gorge is a real classic that deserves its reputation. It’s a fun paddle at most levels, but becomes more pushy at high flows. The bouldery upper section requires lots of water, but is well worth visiting if the conditions are right. The North Esk is also a popular salmon river where other people get their enjoyment from fishing. At the moment, the relationship with the fishermen is good, due to local boaters being friendly and considerate. The only other moving hazard here is the odd tree that becomes stuck, usually in the worst place possible.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is the section at the head of the glen, starting from the put-in at Loch Lee car park. The enthusiastic can walk up to the loch from here. This section is a must in high water, and a good place to go if the lower section is too high. It is a boulder run with a couple of bedrock drops. The river is broad and open and has no constrictions on it.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Looking upstream from Gannochy Bridge, the take-out for the lower section, the river has to be peaty brown and should appear to be in flood. The only true gauge is to drive to the top and check out the last rapid under Dalbrack Bridge, as this is the hardest obstacle. 1.0 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving north from Edzell on the B966, cross the river at Gannochy Bridge and turn left into Glen Esk. Access to this section is from the car park at the top of the glen close to Loch Lee. Egress is at Dalbrack Bridge, which is signposted off the main glen road. There is parking to be found just before the bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Almost immediately the river starts to pick up in gradient and soon you are reading and running grade 3+ water. Watch out for a couple of tricky rapids that lurk for the unwary (Gd 4+). The first major rapid is next to the road and can have a very tricky hole in the middle. The river now runs away round a corner and into a second rapid. The next two rapids are somewhat harder and are both carved from the bedrock, the rapid at Dalbrack having a particularly tricky slot to negotiate. The take-out is just around the corner from here on the left at a sandy beach.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The lower section ends at Gannochy Bridge near the village of Edzell. This section starts as a flat pebbly run, becoming steeper and gathering pace as it enters the Gannochy Gorge. The gorge is shallow at first, gradually cutting deeper into the bedrock to give deep pools intermixed with short technical rapids at regular intervals. Lower down the rock type changes, as does the character of the river, making it a varied and interesting paddle with a few surprises!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">As most of this section is in a gorge, it can still be paddled in relatively dry conditions. However, the first kilometre down to the gorge becomes very shallow, deterring most people from paddling. Generally, the river takes 3 or 4 days to drain from a high flow, but will remain navigable for some weeks after this. At very high flows the gorge becomes very boily and much more serious. The upper section may be a good option in these conditions. This is one of the few runs that remains paddleable year-round. However, it will be rocky below 0.4m on the SEPA gauge, and very continuous and a grade harder when above 1.5m. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The level can be easily inspected by looking upstream from the take-out at Gannochy Bridge. If the river is wider than 2m at its narrowest point, the whole section should be navigable. The two distinct large shelves of brickwork on the downstream side of the bridge are a useful gauge. If the water level is above the bedrock, onto the first shelf, the river is good to go. If it rises to the next shelf, some six blocks higher, the river is running very high. At the put-in there are some concrete blocks in the channel beneath the footbridge. If these are not showing, then the river is reaching high flow and should be treated with caution. During spate conditions trees often become pinned across the river. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the A90, Dundee to Aberdeen road, turn off just north of Brechin signposted for Fettercairn/Edzel. The take-out is encountered first and is located at Gannochy Bridge, a little under 2 miles past Edzel. Cars can be parked in a lay-by on the left, just the other side of the bridge. On busy days, there is alternative parking on the Glen Esk road, found 100m past the bridge on the left. On no account should the grass in front of the house be used. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To locate the put-in, take the Glen Esk/Invermark turn-off described above. About 3 miles up this road is a large lay-by on the right (NO 57577 75110; 56.8654, -2.6974). There’s <span xml:lang="en-US">plenty<br /></span>of room for cars here if you’re creative, so you might want to leave more vehicles here than in the busy lay-bys at the bottom. You can slide down the hill opposite in various places, depending on how adventurous you’re feeling. At the bottom, find the pathway that goes through the next hill (it’s fairly obvious) and you’ll be at the river. Alternatively, if water levels are low, park around 200m upstream of ‘Jake’s Gate’ (NO 584 741, 56.8569, -2.6836) on the verge and carry down the track to the river.&#160;There is essentially no parking here, so please find an alternative place to leave the car once you’ve dumped the boats.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">For the first kilometre the river is grade 1. A sharp right-angle bend and obvious rock walls signify the start of the gorge section. The gradient becomes slightly steeper with many enjoyable grade 3 rapids. A deep pool and horizon line signifies Shotgun, the first more difficult grade 3/4 rapid. Inspection, protection or portage is best made on the right-hand side. At lower levels this rapid is a sinuous channel, which at higher flows becomes very boily with a nasty stopper forming on the bottom left-hand side. Below here, a good splat wall followed by a mini surf wave form at the right flows. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A couple of straightforward rapids follow <br />before the gorge walls become steeper, the channel narrows, and a horizon line is reached. This is Witches Step. Here the river drops through a narrow slot into a large cauldron. The powerful jet makes a good ender/cartwheel spot, although the pool is quite shallow in places. In very high water, the usual line becomes ‘interesting’ and a safer alternative opens up to the left of the rock shelf that forms the drop. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river now eases off and begins to open out until it plunges into Rocks of Solitude (Gd 4). The entrance rapid, Double Drop, is a steep<br />triplet of stoppers that tend to wash out in high flows. This is followed by a short gorge that constricts into a very narrow channel known as President<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s Corner. Although this is a likely pinning spot at low flows, the entire rapid can be easily protected, inspected or portaged on the left-hand side. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Easing off again the river returns to a pleasant grade 2/3 eventually widening, with the rock type changing to pebbly red sandstone. This marks the lead-in to the final rapid worthy of note, Fish<span xml:lang="en-US">l</span>adder Falls (Gd 4). A series of shallow stoppers well-spaced over 200m ends with an intimidating drop into a boily gorge, beneath the rotting skeleton of a high metal bridge. This is normally run river left, just to the right of a fish ladder, keeping well away from under-<br />cuts on the far right-hand side. Inspection can be easily made on the left<span xml:lang="en-US">.</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">T</span>he final drop<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span><br /><span xml:lang="en-US">however, </span>is very difficult to protect. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A series of grade 2/3 rapids with the odd entertaining playspot leads to the take-out. Egress is possible on the left, some 20m before Gannochy Bridge. Steps are cut in the gorge wall, from where a footpath leads through a gate in the wall to the lay-by.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A fantastic paddle, the West Water is a tributary of the North Esk, and flows through Glen Lethnot. Unfortunately, it rarely has enough water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">You need a big flood for this one. If every river you see is bursting its banks, this is worth a look. You can inspect the level from your car as you drive along.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">In Edzell, take the turning at the mini-roundabout at the northern end of the village to Bridgend. Cross the river, and take the right turn up the glen. The put-in is a car park at the end of the public road. The take-out is a rather nondescript lay-by beside a significant tributary, about 1½ miles upstream of Bridgend.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If you’re lucky enough to catch this one in condition, you’re in for a treat: 10km of continuous, fast-flowing grade 3/4 from start to finish, and never far from the road. There are three stretches where the gradient noticeably increases. The first is only about 1km from the put-in (you should get a glimpse of it on the drive up), so make sure you’re sufficiently alert to catch one of the small eddies to inspect. The second is in the middle of the run under an old footbridge. You will then pass under Stonyford Bridge (NO 505 726; 56.8422, -2.8123). Near the end there is a short gorge section. The river never becomes desperate, and everything can be inspected and portaged, but be ready to catch an eddy if you suspect the gradient is increasing.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Continue on past the put-in for the West<br />Water until the public road ends at a car park. Carry your boat up the road and then up the zigzag path at the head of the glen. Put in where the path is once again near the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a great run, which is well worth the effort. The hard white water is tucked away in the loop which flows away from the path, and may be worth inspecting before you commit to the carry. A series of slabby drops gives fun but serious white water. This is followed by easier water leading back to the car, or on down the West Water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The West Water will need to be huge for this one. With less water the run should still go, and might be a little less serious.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The River South Esk flows from Glen Clova to Montrose Basin through a mixture of mountainous landscape, forested estates and open pasture. The greatest interest to kayakers lies along the geological fault, which separates red sandstone from Highland igneous rock. This fault provides the steepest paddling in the neighbouring rivers, the Blackwater and North Esk. The South Esk is bouldery with a mini-gorge above Cortachy Castle.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A quick way to assess the level without committing to a long drive up Glen Clova is from the A90 past Forfar at the Finavon Diner. Looking downstream from the bridge, a boulder weir/salmon pool has been constructed. If this is covered then the river is reasonable. If covered enough to form an easy play hole, then the river will be good. If the river is too low, surfing at Lunan Bay is an option or cave exploring on the Angus coast.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving up Glen Clova from Kirriemuir, the picnic site at Gella Bridge is reached after 8 miles. Put in here, or further up the glen. Take out at the bridge in Cortachy, parking is available a few hundred metres north of the bridge, or continue on. Longer touring trips can be made and the public park in Brechin makes a handy take-out. Please be considerate with parking and changing, do not damage the verges and follow the Paddlers’ Access Code http://canoescotland.org/where-go</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The upper reaches contain two good grade 3 rapids. The first is a left-hand corner ledge <br />situated 1.5km from Gella Bridge. The outside of the corner has a narrow constriction, which is often choked by trees and rubbish and is best avoided. Sometimes called The Wall of Death it hardly merits the title. From here on grade 2 water leads into the gorge, which has some nice ledges and a final drop barred by two boulders/ledges giving left, right and middle chutes to choose from. In very high water the gorge can arguably reach grade 5. Below Cortachy bouncy grade 2s are found at regular intervals all the way to the sea. A number of steep weirs also provide sport, the most serious being below Brechin at Kinnairds Mill. It’s quite long, with a steep salmon ladder that forms a set of power-<br />ful closed-ended stoppers. Improvements for salmon fishing have created pools and ledges providing playspots on the lower reaches.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Tucked in the hills of Angus, the Melgan flows from Lintrathen Reservoir, joining the River Isla and flowing into the Tay near the famous beech hedge at Meiklelour. The Melgan starts as a rocky ditch that runs through farmland. Open to begin with, it drops into a shallow gorge that becomes deeper. The rapids are all hard and often committing. Their rough-hewn nature leads to the possibility of major damage to both kayak and paddler. Probably one of the more demanding/rewarding runs of the east.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Lots water is needed to fill the reservoir, then more for the overflow. With dam releases rare (it provides the main drinking water reservoir for the good people of Dundee and Perth) it is hard to determine when the river will be running. The best time of year to check it out is October to April, as outside these times the water level in the loch shrinks rapidly due to demand. Don<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>t be alarmed by the lack of water<br />coming down the dam outflow; this is not the Spean. As long as the right side of the top of the first drop looks runnable then there are high jinks to be had further down the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Head north out of Dundee on the A90. Turn off onto the A926 towards Kirriemuir. Go through Kirriemuir and take the B951 towards<br />Glenshee. After about 8 miles there will be a left turn sign posted to Bridgend of Lintrathen.<br />Follow the road to the village and park at the earth dam wall. Downstream is the top of the first drop. Go through the gate above the bridge and down to the channel below the dam wall. To find the take-out, follow the road on river right. Egress is from the second small bridge downstream approximately 2 miles along the minor road. Alternatively continue down the Isla to the bridge on the Alyth road.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The first drop is a two-stage fall, which gives you a flavour of the trip to come. If it looks too hard and you are going to walk it, put your boat back on the roof and move on. If the first drop looks too easy, be warned – it has kept a boat pinned for 36 hours. After this drop the river is flat for about 1km with the local farmer putting fences across it in a couple of places making carrying your boat around a nuisance but necessary. Two large gnarly falls bring you to the main gorge section. This is made up of an ‘interesting’ series of drops, which have rearranged the front end of many a creek boat and resulted in the loss of sanity of several paddlers (sadly not always temporarily). Trees can be quite a problem.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The River Isla makes a dubious trip in a deep gorge from Reekie Linn, just below the B954 at Bridge of Craigisla, to the bridge on the<br />Alyth road (see Melgan description). There are several awkward portages and few runnable rapids. In fact, this trip is really just canyoning with a boat. Perhaps if you make the first descent of ‘the Linn’ you may be the kind of paddler who will find this stretch worthwhile. Having said that, the trip gets a surprising number of repeat descents, even if just for the novelty of leading others down to the ledge in the depths of the gorge with no apparent portage. Throw your boat in from the ledge on river left, then jump in after. Definitely stay away at high flows!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Blackwater drains the Cairngorms from Glenshee to the south. It runs parallel to the A93 (Blairgowrie to Braemar) until its confluence with the Ardle at Bridge of Cally. From here the river is known as the Ericht, flowing through Blairgowrie to meet the Isla and eventually the Tay. After the fun of Milton Falls, the Blackwater becomes a relatively quiet stretch of water flowing through lush Perthshire countryside. This all changes at Ashmore <span xml:lang="en-US">G</span>orge. Here you will find twisting rapids and drops, entertaining places to play and a few easily avoided undercuts. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Moderate flows are required for this section to run. With more water it becomes increasingly entertaining. At very high flows it is a serious run, which is a grade harder and demands a good deal more respect. As the Blackwater drains the Cairngorms, high flows are more frequent during spring snow melt. Looking upstream over Netherton Bridge, two rocks are evident side by side in the middle of the stream. If they are showing well above the water, the river is too low to navigate. If they are nearly or completely covered, the river is running at a good level. If they are nowhere to be seen, then the Netherton rapid (upstream) should indicate what the high-water conditions will involve. A reading of 0.8 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the take-out, turn off the A93 Blairgowrie to Braemar road, about ¼ mile past Bridge of Cally. Follow the winding road to a bridge over the river. The SCA egress point is about 100m downstream of Netherton Bridge on river left. To reach the put-in, drive back to the A93 and continue up towards Braemar for 3 miles. The minor road to Blackhall Farm crosses the river at this point. Park in the lay-by just north of the farm turn-off. The put-in is immediately upstream of the Milton Falls, which can be seen from the bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Putting in directly above Milton Falls doesn’t leave much time to warm up. Many ice-cream heads have been experienced here, normally by those wiping the sleep from their eyes in the spring snow melt. The final drop is split, most paddlers opting for the right chute, as the left-hand chute has been known to pin boats. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">After the falls, the river eases off until Ashmore <span xml:lang="en-US">g</span>orge. This is marked by steeply rising walls and a right-hand bend guarded by a large truck<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>sized boulder. Care should be taken here, as trees often block the river immediately upstream of the trickiest piece of the gorge. Inspection of the following rapid is advised. If the start of the rapid has a drop exceeding 1m, then the river is at low-medium flow. A route down the right is best to avoid a sharply under-<br />cut rock on the left. If the rapid is a series of holes, with no obvious drop, then the river is high. Whatever route is taken, it is sure to be an entertaining ride. Rapids continue to be frequent and fun with the odd place to play. A short quiet section signifies the end of Ashmore <span xml:lang="en-US">G</span>orge. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Netherton rapid follows which, unless in spate, winds from right to left and back, with a good playhole for those with a quick roll. Beyond this, the river drops past a small rock face, and rounds a corner to the bridge, giving a nice rapid, Slide over Darling (Gd 3). Continue on downstream for about 100m to reach the take-out on river left. A steep climb and short walk bring you back to a gate beside the bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The egress point has been negotiated with the locals to avoid damage to trees and the river banks. If adhered to, relations with the residents should remain friendly. Care should be taken to avoid causing difficulties for lorries crossing the narrow bridge – try leaving your car further up the road, opposite the church. Please also be discreet about changing. When the river is low, the section between Milton Falls and Ashmore <span xml:lang="en-US">G</span>orge becomes very shallow, and the North Esk is probably a better bet. Don’t be tempted to paddle on into the Ericht, as the unnavigable Craighall Gorge lies below the confluence, and before the paddleable section of the Ericht described below.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Ericht runs from its formation at the confluence of the Ardle and Blackwater at Bridge of Cally, alongside the A93 into Blairgowrie, and then on to join the Isla. The section of the Ericht above Blairgowrie is relatively open with a variety of rapids, and a few interesting playspots when the river is high. It offers a mellow alternative for those unwilling to tackle its close neighbour, the Blackwater. At ‘normal’ heights, it is a gem among grade 2/3 rivers affording constant and testing fun in an ever-changing but always beautiful setting.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Ericht can be paddled in moderately wet conditions, but really only shows its true potential when the river is high. Spring snow melt can also quickly aid the water levels, due to close proximity to Glenshee and beyond. Look upstream over the bridge in Blairgowrie. If there are few or no rocks showing above the small weir, the river can be regarded as runnable. Seeing more rocks indicates that the run will be a ‘bump and scrape’. A reading of 0.8 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum. At very high flows, 1.5 or above, the run is a very continuous grade 3/4 blast: taking out well above Cargill’s leap is recommended.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving north out of Blairgowrie, the new A93 bypasses the Ericht Gorge. There is a bridge over the river on the edge of town; about 1½ miles after this, take right turn onto the old road signposted for Craighall circular path. Drive down this road (please close the gate) until you see a worn area under the crash barrier where boats have been pushed through. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The approach to the river is interesting in itself. Cross the road and scramble down the steep wooded bank until a path is reached which, followed north, will take the now muddied paddler to an eddy under the cliffs supporting Craighall House, which lies on the opposite bank. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The first egress point is immediately upstream of a broken weir, using the car parking offered by the Keathbank Mill’s visitor centre. Alternatively, take out in Blairgowrie, where there is parking on the right bank immediately upstream of the A93 road bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the put-in below Craighall House, the river<br />offers some small surf spots, and is generally simple. The first kilometre through secluded, mixed woodland provides opportunity for an energetic workout between sharp eddy lines and enjoyable surf waves. Passing under the road bridge over the A93 after around 1.5km, you enter the once thriving and now beautifully overgrown mill country, where more distinct rapids are to be found. A broken-down weir offers little hazard if taken carefully, and the paddler soon passes the confluence of the Lornty Burn on the right. From here paddle under a pipe and around either side of an island. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The take-out at Keithbank Mill is best accessed from the left bank. The weir below is partially collapsed and can be run with care. The next access point is at the footbridge 200m below. Get out on the right for a strenuous haul up to portage Cargill’s Leap. The Leap, even at levels when it appears simple, hides large undercuts and caverns. You may decide to run Cargill’s through the narrow, back-looping, head-grinding chicken chute on river right but beware of the easy looking left-hand run. The aerated water conceals a shelf and dangerous undercut. This is followed by a seemingly simple corner that, as indicated by the boily water downstream, hides a sump-like feature, which is best avoided. Re-entering the river after the Leap offers a few hundred metres of light paddling to the car park, river right, above the partially broken weir at the bridge in Blairgowrie.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From Bridge of Cally, the river runs through the scenic, tempting, but dangerous Craighall Gorge, scene of more than one TV rescue show. This deep canyon has, at its crux, a nasty tree choked and undercut passage. At the best of times this will be difficult and dangerous to portage and we suspect it will often be impossible to get around. Other than this nastiness there is no white water of note in this gorge and it is definitely not recommended!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent para-style-override-6"><span class="Pesda-Italics char-style-override-2" xml:lang="en-US">On 27th February 2000, Donald Bryce drowned in the turbulent waters downstream of Cargill’s Leap while helping with a high-water kayak inspection for the 2nd edition of this guide. He had just turned 21. Donald was a very popular mountain and river enthusiast, and a great role model, who lived life to the full. It is speculated that a popped spraydeck caused his tragic swim as he was a fluent<br />roller. He will be forever missed.</span></p>

The Leny is the best known of these runs and has the added advantage that it holds its water well and can be worth visiting even several days after the last rains. In wet conditions, why not explore some of the smaller creeks such as the Calair Burn or the Knaik? Alternatively, the Teith and Allan Water offer slightly easier runs when there is a bit of water around. If the rivers are high, then both the Turret and the Duchray Water offer fine adventures easily accessed from the Central Belt.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The Monachyle is on the north side of Loch Voil near Balquhidder. It is </span><span xml:lang="en-US">a </span><span>20 minute drive north west of the River Leny, between Callander and Killin. Next time you’re visiting Rob Roy’s grave near Balquhidder, the rivers are all huge, it’s still raining, and you happen to have your boat on the roof, go and give the Monachyle Burn a shot. Small eddies, constant boulders, a couple of trees, and two portages, this run never gets really steep, but it keeps on going.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">You need a lot of water for this run, in fact, as much as possible. Just make sure you can get back along the road if the loch’s rising. From where the road crosses the burn, look below and above the falls (second portage). If there isn’t much water – don’t do it. If the river is really<br />surging – get on fast before it drops again.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>From Callander, drive north on the A84 past the River Leny, Loch Lubnaig, and the River Balva</span><span xml:lang="en-US">i</span><span>g (you’ll get a good feel for how much water there is as you drive). Turn right to Balquhidder (the road loops back under the main road) and carry on along the north side of the loch for about 5 miles. If you get to the Monachyle Hotel, you’ve just driven over the Monachyle Burn. Go back and decide if there’s enough water, before driving another ½ mile to find a forest track on the right. From here walk up the track till it stops 3km further up and get in.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Put in where the track ends. Watch out for the weir after 5 minutes – eddy right. The top section is small, tight, rocky and fun, until another burn comes in from the right. The river picks up here, crashing through some nice boulders<br />before a scenic breather section where the river<br />flows under the track. You could get in here if you’ve walked far enough on the way up – or equally get out here if you’re scared! From here the burn rounds a corner into the forest and steepens up. Probably the best set of rapids is coming up. Keep a look out for trees, a couple of slightly harder sections and the first portage – keep eddy hopping. The portage has a bumpy line on the left, a sieved pothole on the right and a nice easy walk round the bank on the left. Get in again and paddle through a few nice features to the top of the 2nd portage where you can get out and have a pint in the hotel.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This trip twins well with a visit to the Calair Burn. Something to do on a rare occasion when there is too much water!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Calair Burn is a small river running north towards Balquhidder, on the edge of the Trossachs. A short stretch with some great grade 4 boating, this is a good run to squeeze in at the end of the day.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is definitely a spate run. You should get a good feel for the level from the rapid at the take-out bridge. If it is only ‘passable’ the run will be a bit bumpy. If this rapid looks fast and fun, the run will be quite hectic!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Find Balquhidder by turning off the A84 via the underpass at the Kingshouse Hotel. Turn left in Balquhidder and left again at the four-way junction after 700m. The bridge over the river at this point makes a suitable take-out. To reach the put-in, return to the four-way junction, turn left and follow the road up the glen. You will find a suitable spot to get on after a mile or so, just beyond the edge of the forest.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Flat initially, the lower river soon enters its steep final kilometre, which contains the best of the action. Generally the rapids are grade 4, though it could be harder at a really big flow. A nice 3m ledge is followed by a fast and twisting slide. The run-in to the ledge is quite full-on, with only a few small eddies. If you find yourself unexpectedly on the lip just boof in the middle! This little section is really full-on in high water, definitely 4+ with two crucial moves in order to avoid a spanking. Unfortunately, the end comes all too soon and the fun is over till another day.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This river runs from the top of Glen Artney into the town of Comrie. The Ruchill is a bouldery river with a continuous drop. Apart from the difficult rapids in the middle, which definitely require inspection and perhaps portaging, it’s a get on and go river. At the level where all the boulders are covered, expect one or two meaty stoppers on the run. The river is brilliant in full spate, but is best avoided at this level unless you know it, or are a very experienced group.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This river rises and falls very quickly and is only worthwhile after prolonged heavy rain. You can get an indication of water levels from the Earn at Comrie. As you drive up the glen all the side streams should be flowing well, with all the rocks at the access point covered. There is a gauge on the SEPA website. 1.0 is a minimum flow, giving a good intermediate trip at grade 2/3 with one grade 4. 2.0 on the gauge is a non-stop grade 4 wave train with a grade 5 drop in the middle. Above 2.5 is flood conditions.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Glen Artney is definitely a ‘sporting’ glen, i.e. fishing and shooting. At the levels we require for paddling there is unlikely to be any conflict with fishermen. There is a single-track road that runs beside the river to the top of the glen. About 1 mile from the end of the road at Glen Artney Lodge there is a picnic spot/car park. Please only use this public access point. The take-out is on the left bank below the main road bridge in Comrie, after the confluence with the River Earn. Car parking is easily found close to the river, but please be considerate.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the start, you are into continuous bouldery rapids. After around 2.5km, these lead to a major rapid at Eas nan Luib (marked as Sput a Chleibh on the OS map, NN 734 178; 56.3356 -4.0506). This long rapid can be broken into three sections with little respite in between. It is best to consider it as a single rapid, since once started, you are committed to the rest. Although considered grade 4 at low flows, this rapid is a challenging grade 5 when the rest of the run is in condition. A long ramp leads to a twisting, boily rapid and finally a steep, difficult drop with a tight exit that cannot be protected. Halfway between Eas nan Luib and Comrie there is another rapid near Cultybraggan Camp, which is grade 4 in higher water. You may wish to inspect. From here, easier<br />water leads down to the confluence with the Earn just above Comrie.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Turret joins the River Earn at Crieff, giving a fun but somewhat rocky trip. An open upper section with some bedrock falls is followed by a lower gorge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This trip would have run more often before the water was stolen by the creation of Loch Turret reservoir. It needs a prolonged period of wet weather to bring the level up enough to overflow the dam, and is more likely to be going towards the end of the winter. Driving up the glen, it is possible to peer into the gorge from the water works building at the side of the road. You will, however, get a truer picture of the flow as you drive to the reservoir. It should be obvious whether there is sufficient water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving west from Crieff on the A85, you cross the river as you leave town. Turn right after the bridge. Cross the next bridge over the river<br />by the distillery and take the first left. The best take-out is just before the road crosses the Barvick Burn, where the road climbs away from the river. Put in at the top of the glen, after the nasty weir below the dam spillway.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The upper stretch is mainly an open boulder run with a couple of classy falls. Highlights include a 4m fall (which we suspect is shallow) and another sizeable fall around large boulders, both grade 5. As the river continues to the bridge halfway through the run, it gets rather blocked and there are several trees growing in unhelpful places. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Below this bridge lies the Falls of Turret. This is a two-stage drop, the first half of which is very marginal and almost certainly a portage. You could probably walk the first drop and have the option of putting in for the lower one via a small path on river left. Below here the river<br />continues in a narrow gorge. This has been paddled at lower flows aided by the water exit-<br />ing from the pipe at the water works. It is<br />described as grade 3, and although it is probably<br />better at higher flows, you would then need to be very careful about trees.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If the river is high, it would probably be wise to scout the lower gorge before putting on. This gives the option of taking out at the bridge above the falls if you don’t like what you see.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Knaik is a small Perthshire run near Braco. It is a nice, easy spate run with some drops and a large ramp/slide. Fast and fun, it can feel rather tight at times.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river should look brown and churning when viewed from the road bridge. It is very ‘flashy’, and can be up and down in a matter of hours. The ideal time to paddle it is immediately after a heavy thunderstorm.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the take-out, drive up the A9 and take the turn-off for Braco (A822). Drive through Braco and park at the bridge on the left. Please change and sort the shuttle out here. To get to the put-in, drive out of Braco and take the first left turning up the glen (the B827 towards Comrie). You can see the river as you drive up. Depending on the amount of water you can start as high up the glen as is possible.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river starts narrow and straightforward, with shallow grade 2 water. A few blind corners and over-hanging trees keep the paddler alert. The first 2km of the river is surrounded by open farmland. There are two wire fences in this section to be aware of; they are passable in high flows and can be portaged at medium flows. The farmers have replaced these fences after damage in flood conditions, caution required – you have been warned! Soon a break-out is required on the right to portage a fence that spans the width of the river. The eddies are small, so keep well-spaced. Below this the river carries on at the same pace. Turning a few corners a horizon line appears, marking the start of four drops. At high flows, the first two have large stoppers. The fourth is perhaps the best - comprising a 5-6m slide into a hole (Gd 4). The acceleration on this is tremendous, and the hole pushes through nicely! Below here the river is good continuous fun, with some great surf waves on the way to the road bridge at Braco. Take out on the left bank, shortly after the bridge, and walk over to the car park.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Keep your eyes peeled for debris/fallen trees etc. Take out in plenty of time to portage the fence.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A Stirlingshire river fed from the Ochils and Coire Odhar, the Allan is easily accessible from the A9. It is a highly enjoyable and continuous spate run. Long rapids, formed by bedrock and boulder combinations, provide good surf waves, eddy lines and pour-overs. For first timers, the river should be flavoured high, when it gives an excellent and continuous run with seemingly endless brown waves and play spots! For those who know the river, and therefore won’t be reading this guide, there are play spots in lower water, but the rest of the river is a scrape.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allan has a small catchment, and relies on run-off from the small burns feeding it. It peaks after 12 or more hours of heavy rain. Once it stops raining, the river drains very quickly. The park in Bridge of Allan is the usual place to check the flow. The water should ideally be well over the weir and chocolate brown, with an intimidating stopper forming under the bridge. If the river is spilling into the park, expect an outstanding and eventful trip. 0.9 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum level.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Park by the bridge, and take out either on the right above the weir in Bridge of Allan or on the left below it. Parking at the put-in is limited so it is best to sort out your shuttle to take as few cars as possible to the top. Drive up the A9 until the turn-off for Kinbuck. Turn right and then left down the road signposted to Ashfield. As you approach the village you drive over a railway bridge. Access to the river on foot is from the track on the right.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At high flows this river is impressive right from the start. The rapids blur into one continuous stretch of waves, providing constant entertainment. It is<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> however, easy to get complacent and end up in one of the Allan’s many innocuous looking holes. If you have never paddled the river before, particularly in spate, it would be prudent to inspect at the major rapids. The first of these, Ashfield Weir, immediately followed by Mill Falls (Gd 4), is found just after the put-in. Inspection is easiest from river right. After some good paddling, an obvious stone railway bridge on the right warns of the next major rapid, Cathedral Weir in Dunblane. This weir has a nasty tow-back and is generally inspected or portaged on river right. Below Dunblane, a scenic grade 3 stretch leads to the Wall of Death, a grade 4 fall, which has several possible lines depending on the level. The final weir under the bridge at Bridge of Allan is renowned for its holding power and is not a place for the faint-hearted. Inspect or finish on the right above the weir.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a spate run, so keep your eyes open for tree blockages and other debris; expect to be surfing waves with large tree stumps! Although technically easy, in high flows the continuous nature, overhanging branches and lack of eddies make this river a serious undertaking for those who aren’t confident or can’t reliably roll on big water.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Fed from Loch Lubnaig by the River Leny and Loch Venachar (which is dam controlled), the Teith flows through Callander and on to Stirling. In flood, it makes a good trip even for more experienced paddlers, but it is not then recommended for novices due to overhanging trees and the lack of eddies.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river can be paddled at most water levels, but is best avoided when low. The water board releases water <span xml:lang="en-US">only </span>when Loch Venachar is too high. They try to avoid peak spates on the Leny to prevent flooding in Callander. This sometimes leads to a situation where the water is still high in the Teith when it<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s dropping on the Leny. The water level is best viewed from the Meadows car park in Callander. If the car park is flooded, then the river is in full spate. It will be a big bouncy grade 2, with small holes and surf waves on which to play. It is worth considering paddling down to Deanston at this level.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving north along the A84 from Stirling, just before you cross the Teith Bridge at Doune, there is a minor road on the left which leads to the egress at Deanston. Further up the A84, the usual egress below the Torrie Rapid is from a lay-by on the right at Drumvaich. Put in from the Meadows car park, adjacent to the river at the north end of Callander.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river is grade 1/2 for most of its length. The main rapid at Torrie comes immediately after a left-hand bend and is usually shot down a chute on the left. In high water there are big holes on the right and big waves below Torrie. The usual egress is 800m below Torrie on the left and is well signposted from the river. It is possible to continue down to Deanston. There is a large weir above Deanston, which should be inspected due to the metal rails in the salmon run. These have damaged kayaks in the past. There is an extremely large and intimidating hole at the bottom of the weir in high water. Shoot the weir just left of a salmon run to take the tail through the bottom hole. Get the line wrong and you’re mincemeat! Take out immediately below the treatment plant at Deanston on the river right, or continue to the bridge to enjoy the play waves by Deanston distillery.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river is heavily fished during the season and should be avoided in low water. It is better to paddle on a Sunday, when the river is full, or out of season to avoid those folk waving about long stick like things in the middle of the river. The trip can be further extended from Deanston down to Stirling at grade 1.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Keltie flows into the Teith above Callander. A dream river that I’ve talked about and looked at a lot more than I’ve paddled. The whole river is an excellent run, broken up by Bracklin Falls, which are unlike any others. There aren’t many places in Scotland that have slab formations quite like this. The main rapids on the river are bedrock interspersed with boulder gardens and shingle beaches thrown in for good measure.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is one of those rivers that, for the stretches in between the falls, the more water the better. However, some of the falls get kinda scary when it’s really wet so a compromise needs to be reached. It certainly needs saturated ground and a fair quantity of rain the night before to bring it into condition. From the bridge at the take-out, you can get a pretty good idea of the level. If it’s really rocky, it’s too low; not rocky at all, it may be too high! For a much better idea, look at the top falls. Try and get a balance between a) the hole at the bottom of the first 3-tier fall being a muncher, and b) the slab lead-in to Kerplunk having enough water to paddle rather than scrape. Be wary of getting on if you’re not sure, since it rises quickly, and you may change your mind when you get to Bracklin. The section between Kerplunk and Bracklin is an absolute nightmare if it’s too low.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The take-out is about a mile from Callander on the road </span><span>towards Stirling, opposite a campsite. Bracklin Falls are signed (small sign) up a road on the right just as you enter Callander from the south – opposite the ‘Roman Camp’. Make sure you keep on this road instead of going into the Golf Club. The road goes steeply up and you come to a car park on the right (NN 637 083; 56.2478, -4.2011). There is a sign here telling you about the falls. The 15-minute walk in or out from here is a good alternative put-in or take-out point, and also a good place for shuttle-<br />bunnies and tourists to walk in to take photos.<br />To reach the upper put-in, instead of stopping at the car park, keep going up the road (through the gate) for another couple of miles. There is a slip road off to the right with a locked gate. Park here and walk down to see the upper falls and put-in. If you don’t want to do these, you probably won’t want to do Bracklin.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>Put in above the bridge and negotiate the first three-tier drop as best you can. Don’t get stuck in the hole, then continue on through the gorge leading up to Kerplunk – watch out for the flat rock at the bottom. A couple of kilometres of fairly constant though easyish rapids follow (don’t do this section unless the river is pumping) before Bracklin Falls are reached. Make sure you eddy out before them, since the top two falls are of ‘iffy’ runability. Get in immediately below the second drop, down through the grippy hole and over the 3m ledge. Eddy-out above the bridge to regroup, before bashing down under the bridge through The Gates of Shangri-La. Eddy-out left behind the huge boulder (you’ll have to trust me here), and then get as good a boof as you can off Haggis Trap – the next (7m+) vertical slab. If you’re well and truly trashed by this point, then hard luck ‘cos there’s one more to go, Trouble or Quits </span><span xml:lang="en-US">– </span><span>a 3m drop onto rock, or a slippy seal-launch off the rock on the left. Then walk back up and do it again! After Bracklin there is little to speak of although it’s nice to float down reminiscing about the falls. There are several grade 3+ rapids and a couple of small holes/waves to play in depending on the level. If the river is low, it might be worth walking out from the falls rather than scraping down the rest.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">In 2017 there was a large tree jammed across the river in the lower part of Bracklin Falls, which might be avoidable in some flows.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Leny is one of those rivers that you will never get bored of. In high water, it is a continuous run, with the falls becoming a challenge demanding respect from the most experienced paddlers. Although very short – it can be paddled in as little as 20 minutes – most will want to play and enjoy the run.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Although the river comes up slowly and needs a prolonged period of rain to get to a recommended height, it does hold its level well once Loch Lubnaig is high, and may still be good a few days after rain. Because the river is fed from the loch, even when it is really high the water is often clear. Check the level at the Falls of Leny, these are safest at a medium level, i.e. most of the rocks will be covered. The gauge on the upstream side of the road bridge at the Lade Inn take-out is best viewed on river right:</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">6” – and the top section is low, the falls not really possible, but bottom section has play potential.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">1’ – the falls can be paddled both sides but are scrapey and have pinning potential.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">4’+ – now serious, the Falls and gorge below are grade 5. The breakout above the falls (last gasp eddy) will be very tight.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">0.8 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum flow, 1.3 on the SEPA gauge is regarded by local paddlers as the ultimate level, 1.5+ is flood conditions and grade 5. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From Callander, drive north on the A84. Park in the lay-by next to the river, just past the turn-off for the Ben Ledi car park. The land next to the lay-by has been fenced off. Follow the fence line downstream – there is a wood chip trail that will bring you to the river. A National Park sign post in the lay-by advises that new car park facilities have been developed a little further north at the end of Loch Lubnaig (but watch out as the gate is locked at night). Alternatively cross the river and park in the Ben Ledi car park. To find the take-out, drive back towards Callander and turn off towards the Lade Inn. Drive over the river to the public car park. Please do not park at the Lade Inn car park unless you intend to have a drink there afterwards. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The first section starts off with easy rapids, but soon gains momentum. There are some good play spots including one good playhole at higher flows and an excellent bouncy grade 3 rapid above the falls. It’s only a short distance from the start to the falls, with very small eddies in high water. Look for the eddy on the right at the remains of the second old railway bridge. There are two eddies immediately above the falls. Choose either the right or left, depending on which side you want to paddle/portage. If all else fails, Last Gasp Eddy is immediately above the falls on the left. Miss it and you paddle the falls backwards! The portage on the right bank is the easiest; the falls themselves are more usually tackled on the left. The exit and gorge below should be inspected in very high water as a huge hole forms. Below the falls the river continues to be interesting with two notable grade 3/4 rapids</span><span xml:lang="en-US">.</span><span> Wee Stinker, which comes<br />after a right-hand bend, is followed by a bouncy stretch leading to the S-Bends. These offset stoppers get nasty at high flows. Below here some good eddy lines and a nice play<a id="x.39444" />hole break up the journey to the take-out.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>Although the river is regularly paddled, the falls should be treated with respect. Please be cautious if inspecting the falls on river left as the path is continuously eroding. Sharp concrete boulders are falling into the river that the bottom of your kayak will not appreciate in lower<br />flows. The whole river has been paddled in an open canoe, but for the less experienced it would be more appropriate to put in at the </span><span>Lade Inn and extend your trip down the Teith. Although the bottom section of the Leny is easy, a trip through the ‘everglades’ is not recommended for novices due to overhanging trees.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Duchray Water runs through Loch Ard Forest to Aberfoyle. Draining the slopes of Ben Lomond via many small burns, the river rises and falls very quickly. It is a continuous run lined by trees and with few eddies when in spate. Apart from the first gorge and two major drops, the river is not technically difficult, but every corner seems to hide an impossible fall, which never materialises. There is a harder rapid near the end, bringing relief from the apprehension.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent para-style-override-7">This one needs to be at the top of its banks, or better still starting to flood in Aberfoyle, with all the boulders covered at the put-in. The surrounding burns will need to be high. Stirling Council have a flood gauge on the river: http://my.stirling.gov.uk/rivers/view/duchray-water/range:week?theme=MyStirling. Between the black lines makes for a grade 2/3(5) trip. Well over the top black line gives a flood run of grade 4/5. Once it stops raining, you have about 3 hours before it’s scrapey again. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Take the B829 Lochard Road out of Aberfoyle. The put-in at Loch Dubh is accessed via a forestry road, from the end of the public road at Loch Dhu. An OS map is definitely worth having to reach the put-in, as there is a network of forestry roads to negotiate. Take out at the footbridge to Milton car park, or carry on another kilometre to the car park (and pub) in Aberfoyle.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Small rapids soon lead to a grade 4 gorge with a couple of interesting drops. Continue on, but stop above a forest road bridge, as this marks a tricky run-in to the Linn of Blairvaich (NS 453 997; 56.1644, -4.4936). The Linn is a 10m fall, which hides round a corner with some complex moves and few eddies above it. Inspection and portage can be done with difficulty on the left, down to a large pool. The fall has been run, but it feels a long way down! The river now gives a lovely bouncy continuous run for over 5km, but stay alert for the river gorging up again for the last big grade 4+ drop, at NN 490 002 (56.1701, -4.43360). </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If you are in the area when everything is flooding, this one is worth a look. The river is quite remote and mobile signal is very patchy, so carry enough kit to deal with problems. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Start 300m upstream of Millfaid. Park in the lay-by just upstream of the bridge to Millfaid House. Carry 200m up the road, turn left up the dirt track and put on at the bridge. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Finish at the River Endrick.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">The river is narrow and not suitable for novices. There is an excellent rapid just below the put-in, but watch for the fence on the bridge to Millfaid. Float past the Catterburn Guide Campsite (two more fences). After a good rapid at Low Gartachorrans, the river gets narrower and steeper. There is a small drop just before Croftamie, then a really good, fast mini-gorge/channel, which is best inspected before you get on the river from opposite the old Post Office. Keep an eye open for trees. The river now eases up: either float down the Endrick to Drymen Bridge or carry back up the pipeline/old railway back to Croftamie.</span></p>
