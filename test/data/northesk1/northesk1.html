			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A well-kept secret among the local clubs in and around Aberdeen, the Don lazily meanders from the Eastern Cairngorms with little to note, other than a few old weirs, until it reaches Aberdeen, where it finally starts to pick up. Unsurprisingly, this being an urban run, the section is defined by man-made weirs with flat sections in between. However, these can provide entertaining rapids, especially at higher flows!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This section can be paddled at any level, with rapids becoming more of a challenge in higher<br />water. If the river looks calm and the water line is a couple of feet lower than the bank the river will be low. If the river is bank full and flowing quickly with some boils it will<span xml:lang="en-US"> be</span> high to huge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Using the Parkhill gauge on the SEPA website: Scrape – 0.9<span xml:lang="en-US">–</span>1, Low – 1<span xml:lang="en-US">–</span>1.2, Medium – 1.2<span xml:lang="en-US">–</span>1.5, High – 1.5<span xml:lang="en-US">–</span>1.8, Huge – &gt;1.8.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Entering Aberdeen from the south, follow the A90 through the city until you join the A96 at the Haudagain roundabout. Follow the signposts for Dyce (A947) then carry on this road for around 1½ miles. Just before the BP office<br />is a right-hand turn. The put-in is at the<br />end of this road, after a short walk down the riverside footpath. With the closure of several offices parking is no issue currently. There are two commonly used take-outs, one at <span xml:lang="en-US">the </span>Bannatyne gym at Danestone and one in Seaton Park further downstream. The gym has an agreement with paddlers to use the corner of their car park furthest from the building if it is quiet. Consider using the Seaton Park take-out if the gym looks busy.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At the put-in the river is calm and slow-<br />moving, allowing for a relaxing warm<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>up before<br />the first weir. This is tucked around the first left-hand bend, a couple of hundred metres downstream. Both hard left and hard right go nicely and those looking for an extra challenge might want to tackle the fish ladder, right of centre. From there, it is only a short distance to the Mill <span xml:lang="en-US">R</span>apid (Gd 3+), which begins just after the next corner – inspect river left. The top of this rapid consists of a broken weir which should be taken river left; river right has several metal spikes in it which are only obvious in low water. Push river right after the weir <span xml:lang="en-US">(</span>to avoid the rocks in low water or <span xml:lang="en-US">the </span>surprisingly retentive holes that form when the river is high<span xml:lang="en-US">)</span> and enjoy the remainder of the rapid! Please note, above 2 on the SEPA gauge expect this rapid to be a full-on grade 4 with some big waves and holes. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river eases off again with a couple of easy shingle rapids while the scenery does its best to make you forget you’re in a city. A large pipe arching over the river notifies you of your<br />imminent approach to the other main rapid on the river, the Double Weir (Gd 3/3+). Inspecting river left is advisable as the first of the two weirs has started to collapse due to flooding in early 2016 and while there is no dangerous debris or metalwork currently in the rapid it could change in the future. At the bottom of the second weir a fun low-water playwave can form. This is also the location of an extreme high-water wave (above 2 on the gauge) nicknamed Hawaii-sur-Don by some former Aberdeen University students, although this may have changed with the first weir collapsing.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent para-style-override-4">A couple more minor rapids and a flat section leads you under a road bridge and onto the last rapid – take the left of centre line between two islands. The take-out at Bannatyne<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s gym is river left at the end of this rapid. If you opted for the lower take-out carry on; the next rapid is a broken weir which is best taken left of centre. At levels above 1.8 on the gauge, a great playwave with eddy access forms on river right here, which only gets better with more water. Continuing downstream is more sedate from now on, just remember to avoid the hard-right channel when the river splits around several islands<span xml:lang="en-US">;</span> it leads to a community hydro scheme! Ending at Seaton Park, you can take out at the slalom site river right or run the last weir to shorten your walk to the car.<span></span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-1"><a id="Anchor-58" />North Esk</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The North Esk runs through Angus, halfway between Aberdeen and Dundee. It<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s in an attractive area, much loved and visited by Queen Victoria. The river itself is one of many that drain eastwards from the great Mounth plateau of the South-East Grampians. It starts life at the bottom of Glen Mark and weaves its way through the rounded foothills of the Angus Glens before heading across the Vale of Strathmore to Montrose Bay. The North Esk runs through a glen that is quiet and sleepy, except on rainy Wednesdays when the local universities invade! It is possible to navigate<br />the river from its source in Loch Lee all the way to the sea<span xml:lang="en-US">;</span> however after Gannoc<span xml:lang="en-US">h</span>y Bridge the river is flat with some grade 2 and the occasional weir. As such it offers little for the white<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>water boater. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There are two main white water sections. The popular lower gorge is a real classic that deserves its reputation. It’s a fun paddle at most levels, but becomes more pushy at high flows. The bouldery upper section requires lots of water, but is well worth visiting if the conditions are right. The North Esk is also a popular salmon river where other people get their enjoyment from fishing. At the moment, the relationship with the fishermen is good, due to local boaters being friendly and considerate. The only other moving hazard here is the odd tree that becomes stuck, usually in the worst place possible.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is the section at the head of the glen, starting from the put-in at Loch Lee car park. The enthusiastic can walk up to the loch from here. This section is a must in high water, and a good place to go if the lower section is too high. It is a boulder run with a couple of bedrock drops. The river is broad and open and has no constrictions on it.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Looking upstream from Gannochy Bridge, the take-out for the lower section, the river has to be peaty brown and should appear to be in flood. The only true gauge is to drive to the top and check out the last rapid under Dalbrack Bridge, as this is the hardest obstacle. 1.0 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving north from Edzell on the B966, cross the river at Gannochy Bridge and turn left into Glen Esk. Access to this section is from the car park at the top of the glen close to Loch Lee. Egress is at Dalbrack Bridge, which is signposted off the main glen road. There is parking to be found just before the bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Almost immediately the river starts to pick up in gradient and soon you are reading and running grade 3+ water. Watch out for a couple of tricky rapids that lurk for the unwary (Gd 4+). The first major rapid is next to the road and can have a very tricky hole in the middle. The river now runs away round a corner and into a second rapid. The next two rapids are somewhat harder and are both carved from the bedrock, the rapid at Dalbrack having a particularly tricky slot to negotiate. The take-out is just around the corner from here on the left at a sandy beach.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The lower section ends at Gannochy Bridge near the village of Edzell. This section starts as a flat pebbly run, becoming steeper and gathering pace as it enters the Gannochy Gorge. The gorge is shallow at first, gradually cutting deeper into the bedrock to give deep pools intermixed with short technical rapids at regular intervals. Lower down the rock type changes, as does the character of the river, making it a varied and interesting paddle with a few surprises!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">As most of this section is in a gorge, it can still be paddled in relatively dry conditions. However, the first kilometre down to the gorge becomes very shallow, deterring most people from paddling. Generally, the river takes 3 or 4 days to drain from a high flow, but will remain navigable for some weeks after this. At very high flows the gorge becomes very boily and much more serious. The upper section may be a good option in these conditions. This is one of the few runs that remains paddleable year-round. However, it will be rocky below 0.4m on the SEPA gauge, and very continuous and a grade harder when above 1.5m. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The level can be easily inspected by looking upstream from the take-out at Gannochy Bridge. If the river is wider than 2m at its narrowest point, the whole section should be navigable. The two distinct large shelves of brickwork on the downstream side of the bridge are a useful gauge. If the water level is above the bedrock, onto the first shelf, the river is good to go. If it rises to the next shelf, some six blocks higher, the river is running very high. At the put-in there are some concrete blocks in the channel beneath the footbridge. If these are not showing, then the river is reaching high flow and should be treated with caution. During spate conditions trees often become pinned across the river. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the A90, Dundee to Aberdeen road, turn off just north of Brechin signposted for Fettercairn/Edzel. The take-out is encountered first and is located at Gannochy Bridge, a little under 2 miles past Edzel. Cars can be parked in a lay-by on the left, just the other side of the bridge. On busy days, there is alternative parking on the Glen Esk road, found 100m past the bridge on the left. On no account should the grass in front of the house be used. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To locate the put-in, take the Glen Esk/Invermark turn-off described above. About 3 miles up this road is a large lay-by on the right (NO 57577 75110; 56.8654, -2.6974). There’s <span xml:lang="en-US">plenty<br /></span>of room for cars here if you’re creative, so you might want to leave more vehicles here than in the busy lay-bys at the bottom. You can slide down the hill opposite in various places, depending on how adventurous you’re feeling. At the bottom, find the pathway that goes through the next hill (it’s fairly obvious) and you’ll be at the river. Alternatively, if water levels are low, park around 200m upstream of ‘Jake’s Gate’ (NO 584 741, 56.8569, -2.6836) on the verge and carry down the track to the river.&#160;There is essentially no parking here, so please find an alternative place to leave the car once you’ve dumped the boats.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">For the first kilometre the river is grade 1. A sharp right-angle bend and obvious rock walls signify the start of the gorge section. The gradient becomes slightly steeper with many enjoyable grade 3 rapids. A deep pool and horizon line signifies Shotgun, the first more difficult grade 3/4 rapid. Inspection, protection or portage is best made on the right-hand side. At lower levels this rapid is a sinuous channel, which at higher flows becomes very boily with a nasty stopper forming on the bottom left-hand side. Below here, a good splat wall followed by a mini surf wave form at the right flows. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A couple of straightforward rapids follow <br />before the gorge walls become steeper, the channel narrows, and a horizon line is reached. This is Witches Step. Here the river drops through a narrow slot into a large cauldron. The powerful jet makes a good ender/cartwheel spot, although the pool is quite shallow in places. In very high water, the usual line becomes ‘interesting’ and a safer alternative opens up to the left of the rock shelf that forms the drop. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river now eases off and begins to open out until it plunges into Rocks of Solitude (Gd 4). The entrance rapid, Double Drop, is a steep<br />triplet of stoppers that tend to wash out in high flows. This is followed by a short gorge that constricts into a very narrow channel known as President<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s Corner. Although this is a likely pinning spot at low flows, the entire rapid can be easily protected, inspected or portaged on the left-hand side. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Easing off again the river returns to a pleasant grade 2/3 eventually widening, with the rock type changing to pebbly red sandstone. This marks the lead-in to the final rapid worthy of note, Fish<span xml:lang="en-US">l</span>adder Falls (Gd 4). A series of shallow stoppers well-spaced over 200m ends with an intimidating drop into a boily gorge, beneath the rotting skeleton of a high metal bridge. This is normally run river left, just to the right of a fish ladder, keeping well away from under-<br />cuts on the far right-hand side. Inspection can be easily made on the left<span xml:lang="en-US">.</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">T</span>he final drop<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span><br /><span xml:lang="en-US">however, </span>is very difficult to protect. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A series of grade 2/3 rapids with the odd entertaining playspot leads to the take-out. Egress is possible on the left, some 20m before Gannochy Bridge. Steps are cut in the gorge wall, from where a footpath leads through a gate in the wall to the lay-by.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A fantastic paddle, the West Water is a tributary of the North Esk, and flows through Glen Lethnot. Unfortunately, it rarely has enough water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">You need a big flood for this one. If every river you see is bursting its banks, this is worth a look. You can inspect the level from your car as you drive along.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">In Edzell, take the turning at the mini-roundabout at the northern end of the village to Bridgend. Cross the river, and take the right turn up the glen. The put-in is a car park at the end of the public road. The take-out is a rather nondescript lay-by beside a significant tributary, about 1½ miles upstream of Bridgend.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If you’re lucky enough to catch this one in condition, you’re in for a treat: 10km of continuous, fast-flowing grade 3/4 from start to finish, and never far from the road. There are three stretches where the gradient noticeably increases. The first is only about 1km from the put-in (you should get a glimpse of it on the drive up), so make sure you’re sufficiently alert to catch one of the small eddies to inspect. The second is in the middle of the run under an old footbridge. You will then pass under Stonyford Bridge (NO 505 726; 56.8422, -2.8123). Near the end there is a short gorge section. The river never becomes desperate, and everything can be inspected and portaged, but be ready to catch an eddy if you suspect the gradient is increasing.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Continue on past the put-in for the West<br />Water until the public road ends at a car park. Carry your boat up the road and then up the zigzag path at the head of the glen. Put in where the path is once again near the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a great run, which is well worth the effort. The hard white water is tucked away in the loop which flows away from the path, and may be worth inspecting before you commit to the carry. A series of slabby drops gives fun but serious white water. This is followed by easier water leading back to the car, or on down the West Water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The West Water will need to be huge for this one. With less water the run should still go, and might be a little less serious.</p>
