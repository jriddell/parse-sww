			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This river flows from Loch Doon near Dalmellington, in a north-westerly direction, to join the Firth of Clyde near Ayr. The Ness Glen section runs from the dam at Loch Doon. <span xml:lang="en-US">To get the most out of this run it’s worth running a few laps of the first kilometre. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The dam at Loch Doon releases a constant compensation flow of 2.6 cumecs, which gives enough water to paddle the Ness Glen section throughout the year. This stretch is not recommended when there</span><span xml:lang="en-US">’</span><span>s a lot of water around due to the serious tree hazard.</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> The flow is occasionally slightly increased and if there appears to be ample water at the put-in, inspecting the run below the small footbridge would be sensible. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Drive south along the A713, through Dalmellington. After the town, take the second right, signposted to Loch Doon. Drive over the dam and park on the left. Follow the path on the river left. <span xml:lang="en-US">A quick walk back up the glen to get your car is easy enough or you can drive down to get your boat by following the track that branches to the left about a kilometre from the dam. If you are looking for a longer trip it is possible to continue to the B714 road bridge after crossing Bogton Loch (NS 462 059; 55.3238, -4.4250).</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The run starts below the dam. The weir 40m downstream is often run in the middle, but has seriously damaged <span xml:lang="en-US">many </span>a boat! (Portage right <span xml:lang="en-US">or start your trip below the weir.</span>) What follows is tight, steep and enjoyable. All of the rapids are grade 3 and can be inspected, but be very careful of tree blockages. Care should be taken and paddlers should be confident of making breakouts. <span xml:lang="en-US">There is a small pool towards the end of the run where the river takes a left and widens. Take out river left to do the run again, or paddle a further 300m downstream and take out at the low bridge where there is parking available.</span></p>
