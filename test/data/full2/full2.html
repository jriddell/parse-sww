			<p class="Section-heading">Fort William Area </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From a paddler’s point of view, Fort William is very much the capital of the Wet West Coast of Scotland. With rainfall recorded here on an average of 250 days per year, it’s easy to see why. The rivers here are generally spate runs which are quick to rise and fall, sometimes frighteningly so! If you’re unlucky and find dry conditions then perhaps Glen Spean to the north or Glen Etive to the south will be a better bet. When the rains come and the rivers rise the white-water paddler is spoilt for choice. Go scare yourself on the Upper Nevis or Allt Mhuic, or try a more controlled trip on the Loy or Arkaig. The more adventurous might try Ardgour and beyond for some wilder, more remote, runs. There is something here to suit all tastes. In the town itself, you’ll find plenty<br />of choice for food and drink. There is also a reasonable selection of outdoor gear shops (sadly no paddling shop currently), an excellent climbing wall and a swimming pool with sauna<br />for easing off the shoulders after a long day of bashing down borderline unrunnable ditches! With its hospital and hectic (!?) night life, Fort William itself caters for all eventualities. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Tucked away on the ‘wrong side’ of Loch Arkaig, the Allt Camgharaidh is one of three rivers that drain into the loch at its western end. A short fun trip with the odd hole to keep you on your toes and a great drop to finish, it is well worth the trip up the tortuous road from the milk run on the River Arkaig.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">No tiny burn, the Allt Camgharaidh should hold its water reasonably well, and is worth a peek after a period of moderate rainfall. You will need to get a feel for how wet the day is from elsewhere. The best you can manage is to peer across the loch, ‘Um’ and ‘Ah’ thoughtfully, then toss a coin to decide if the paddle across the loch will be worth the effort. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the put-in for the River Arkaig, drive west for what seems like forever, on the minor road beside the loch. At Rubha Giubhais, just before the road climbs away from the loch, you will find limited parking in a lay-by. It’s a little under a kilometre to paddle across the loch, then a 1km walk up, best on river left. The tributary that cascades into the river on the far bank marks the most obvious put-in. The fit and keen could walk higher.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river has a beautiful setting. It runs through an unspoilt and seldom visited glen, where remnants of Caledonian pine forests provide a taste of Scotland long since gone. The river is not super steep, and you’ll be able to appreciate the beauty of the surroundings. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the put-in (at a sketchy looking drop by the tributary) you are straight into the upper gorge. This is tight and fast and there isn’t much space for more than three boats. Grade 4 at lower levels, it gets harder with more water. Remember when you’re inspecting on the walk up, that everything looks smaller from above! The gorge opens out, but the fun’s not over; watch out for a slightly bigger drop with a sticky hole at the bottom. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Slides and drops continue below this. The best is saved till the end, with the last drop falling into the loch itself. This is Grizzly, a grade 5 with a tight line to avoid the cave behind the fall, or an easy portage on river left. The waters of the loch welcome you at the bottom; a great way to finish the trip. Well not quite, you still have to paddle back across the loch.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The upper reaches of Glen Arkaig hide several other small creeky runs. Go explore.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A great little river with a nice series of clean drops followed by a slightly more adventurous section. Pack the elbow pads.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allt Mhuic can be run in any decent-sized spate, but might be a little scrapey unless there’s been a good bit of rain. The level shoots up and down in no time at all! </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Follow directions for the put-in for the River Arkaig. You will find the river 4 miles further along the Loch Arkaig road where there is a small Forestry Commission car park. The best access is up the river left bank. Walk up until you get to the bridge over the first big slide. Put in river left upstream of the bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river starts with a steep slide which launches you straight into a clean double drop. From here you can enjoy a good few slides and clean drops. All too soon a big double drop appears and you will want to make sure you find a suitable eddy in good time; there is a nice eddy on the right immediately before the drop. This 17m double drop has been run but be sure to have a quick sanity check before committing: not one to mess up! It has an awkward start on the river left, and requires a solid boof to ensure a flat landing as the pool on the second drop is not very deep. After this the river gets a bit more sketchy, but offers some exciting drops, including a gnarly double through a natural arch; be sure to boof on a left hand stroke to avoid denting your boat/paddles/head/general structural integrity on the tight landing before heading through the arch. Stick right to finish this one. If in doubt, take your time to scout or portage as things can creep up on you quickly!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This river needs a day of moderate rain to get it going. At more than a medium level, the upper gorge will be a serious undertaking.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Mallie is on the south west side of Loch Arkaig. Drive up the loch for about 2 miles then paddle across. Walk up a good track for about 4km and put on at a flat section before it steepens out of sight.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The best action starts straight away. The river<br />steepens from the put-in and you are into grade 3 territory with small drops, twists and turns for about 150m. Two grade 4 rapids, with good eddies on river left, precede a bigger drop. All will require a scout. The waterfall, Hide and Seek, is about 4–5m and runs at grade 4+. There is a last chance eddy on river right above, and a straightforward line river left. Watch out for the powerful hydraulic at the bottom and a cave behind the fall. You can protect the fall from river right above. The next mini gorge is a sweet grade 3+ technical section for about 100m. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">After this, the river relaxes and runs at grade 2+ with the odd playwave to keep you entertained for 2km before you come to a bridge. Directly under this is the final grade 3+ section, a ramp with a hole to punch before a boily slot that bends round to the left. A couple more twists and turns and it’s back to the loch to tap into your reserves for the paddle back.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allt Chia-aig is a tributary of the mighty River Arkaig, situated close to Fort William just north of Spean Bridge. Described as a true ‘Highland epic’ by those foolish enough to paddle this burn, the Allt Chia-aig is more of an adventure than an everyday kayaking trip.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Sadly, there is now a hydro scheme on the river,<br />so it may no longer be worth the effort. The water returns at the very end of the run, above the final fall by the road so the flow here can be misleading and you may require more water than you think for the rest of the run. Don’t be put off by this cascade; some of the run is a little nicer!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">See directions to the Arkaig. Park in the Forestry<br />Commission car park just before you cross the Allt Chia-aig and head up the forest walk which leads steeply up through the trees. At the forest road, turn left and continue up the glen. When you can’t be bothered to walk any further and the river upstream appears to be flattening off, cut down through the forest, aiming to get on below a large ugly fall (the entrance to the Alamo Gorge).</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The first descent of this river had much to do with a dry spell in Fort William (in itself an unusual event), on a drunken night in the Commando Bar and far too much testosterone floating around. All that you need to know about this river can easily be gleaned from a few quotes from the epic that followed:</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-2">“If I ever get out of this, I’m going to kill you.” “Oh my God, I need a shorter boat.” <br />“Ouch.”<br />“He just went down!”, “Yeah, which way?” <br />Thump.<br />“This isn’t !?!?!?!?!? canoeing.” <br />“Remember the Alamo.”<br />“Did anyone bring a climbing rope?”<br />“That was a nice drop, what’s that doing on this river?” </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent para-style-override-4"><span>Surprisingly this run has had several descents and even return visits. The lower half of the final fall can be played on as a park &amp; huck, which adds a bit of excitement to an Arkaig trip.</span><span></span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A considerable river, the Arkaig drains a wild and remote mountain area close to Fort William. It links Loch Arkaig to Loch Lochy. The splendour of both lochs can be enjoyed from the put-in and take-out. The river offers only one difficult rapid, which can be portaged. The rest of the run has some surf waves, giving an entertaining if short paddle; ideal if time is tight or you are looking for a second or even third run of the day. If you are paddling along the road at the get-on, buckle up for the most exciting trip on the Arkaig you’ll ever have. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Looking upstream from the road bridge at Bunarkaig (NN 187 878), the last rapid can be seen. If this rapid is mainly rock with only one line, river left, the run will be low. No rocks here and the run will be high. The Arkaig rises slowly, due to the size of Loch Arkaig. In the past it has been worth a visit even several days after heavy rain, but with the construction of a dam taking water from the main event, this may no longer be the case.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Arkaig can be reached from just north of Spean Bridge, by turning onto the B8004 at the Commando Memorial. After crossing the Caledonian Canal, turn right and follow the signs to Bunarkaig. The obvious road bridge shows the last rapid. Parking is available at the take-out located beside the loch, some 200m before the bridge. To reach the top of the river, follow the road and turn left at the next collection of houses. Cross the Allt Chia-aig and park at the loch end.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the put-in, paddle the short distance along the loch and under the road bridge. The pillars create some good eddy lines to warm up and play on. Heading on downstream, the river is flat until you come to a left-hand bend. A new dam was built here in 2016, which looks very dangerous at most levels. The developers have promised remedial works to make the weir safer, but at present it looks like a potential death trap when the river is high. A new portage path has been put in on river left at the lip of the dam, from which you can inspect the dam and the Main Event, the only major rapid of the trip which lies just beyond. Caution is required at high flows as the eddy here is not very big. It’s possible to portage the dam and get back in just below to run the Main Event. With lots of water, this rapid is quite impressive with big rolling holes and an alpine feel. Check out both sides of the island; if the river is high you may be tempted to carry back up to run the other side as well. A new surf wave has formed downstream of the outflow from the hydro scheme, which at some flows is very playable and eddy serviced. There are more surf waves downstream but most are ‘one shot wonders’. The last rapid above the bridge comes all too soon. It is an easy grade 3 in all levels of water. You’re now on Loch Lochy – the SCA agreed egress point lies just along the loch shore on river right.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Arkaig is a run that obviously winds its way through someone’s back yard. The banks are beautifully tended and ornate paths wind alongside the river to a summer-house. Please keep noise to a minimum, respect your surroundings and you will be made very welcome.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The River Loy flows south-east out of Glen Loy and into the River Lochy, some 3 miles north of Fort William. It is a short spate river, with a number of rapids and small drops, which provide great entertainment. Narrow and tree lined, fallen trees can end up in the river! The single-track road up Glen Loy is adjacent to the river bank for most of its length, making it easy to scout on the way to the put-in.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This run needs lots of rain. Not altogether rare in these parts, but the relatively smaller catchment area of this river makes it slower to come up than the likes of the Roy. There’s a gauge painted on the downstream side of the B8004 road bridge. At 1, the river is just high enough, although the wider bits will be shallow and bumpy. Below this level you are signing on for a geology field trip. At 2, the river starts to flex its muscles and one or two moderately&#160;retentive features appear. A reading of 3 or above is fun for strong, confident paddlers. Rescues will be difficult as the river flows through the trees and the eddies disappear. At this flow the river should be considered a solid and continuous grade 4.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the river, follow the B8004 (the back road between Fort William and Spean Bridge, through the village of Banavie) until you cross the river at an obvious humpbacked bridge. Drive up the road beside the river for a little over 1km and get on beside a large gravel lay-by where the river is flat. If you prefer a longer warm-up get on at the next bridge at Inverskilavulin (NN 125 831) or continue on to the end of the tarmac road. Take out upstream of the B8004 road bridge. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If you start at the end of the tarmac the river is low volume and bouldery with a couple of bedrock rapids. The small island should be passed on its right-hand side. Look out for the remains of an old dam and beware of river-wide strainers from adjacent plantations in this upper section. From the bridge at Inverskilavulin, the first kilometre provides a good warm-up. A series of small rapids leads to 3 drops, which can be inspected on the drive up. The largest has 3 chutes, and is best boofed down the middle one; the landing is fairly shallow. The river eases briefly, before the action picks up once more. After a right-hand bend, the next ledge goes on the far right; watch out for an awkward midstream boulder just over the lip. Further downstream, a grippy pour-over is best avoided, although at some levels it can provide good entertainment for the brave and the unwary. The last rapid offers a choice of routes. Take out river right above the B8004 road bridge. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">In 2016 a salmon-counting trap was placed across the width of the river below the road bridge. This was soon washed away leaving just tangled remains, but may be reinstated and is scheduled to be in the river for the next few years. If the salmon trap is not there when you paddle the river, you may be tempted to continue downstream, through the tunnel under the Caledonian Canal. This is a great fun way to end your trip and is highly recommended. At very high water levels, headroom in the tunnel might be limited! Return to the road via a small side tunnel river left.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Parking at the take-out is a bit limited, so please try not to obstruct the narrow road. Chris Pedley reports some good steep grade 4 action at the head of the glen if levels are really high. Walk up a kilometre or so from the road end.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The River Spean becomes the Lochy at<br />Mucomir Power Station and flows sedately to Fort William. This run provides a gentle introduction to moving water. At very high flows this river becomes a different animal; expect huge waves and some munchy stoppers.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river always holds water, but can become fast in spate conditions. You can check the flow at the put-in. The first shingle rapids give a good indication of the trip; 0.6 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum level.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The best put-in is half a mile downstream of Mucomir Power Station, on the back road from Spean Bridge to Fort William, B8004. Alternatively for a shorter trip, put in at the take-out for the River Loy, and paddle through the tunnel under the Caledonian Canal (watching out for the fish counter). Take out just before Fort William at Inverlochy. Driving south towards Fort William, turn right off the A82 just past the junction with the A830 opposite the petrol station (sign-posted to Old Inverlochy Castle). Take the first right and cross the outflow from the aluminium factory. Just past the castle ruins there is a large car park for Stramash Nursery. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The run consists mainly of grade 1/2 shingle rapids with one grade 3 on a left-hand bend at Eas nan Long (The Waterfall of the Ship), more commonly referred to as Torcastle. At low water, this rapid is a straightforward chute into a pool. With more water it becomes a powerful rapid with several alternative chutes, surging boils and powerful eddy lines. Take out river left, after the road bridge, and above the railway bridge. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Just downstream is the outflow from the<br />aluminium smelter. Depending on the river level and the state of the tide, this tailrace can provide a fine playspot but is more normally a boily mess. The river has a tendency to collect tree debris which may become a hazard, particularly at high flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">It is possible to make a round trip by paddling up the Caledonian Canal from Neptune’s Staircase, and portaging into the river at Gairlochy; possibly not the most exciting white water-option! </p>

Park at the Nevis Range ski area and then walk 3km up the forest road. After that there is a further 2.5km walk to the top of the river.

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Some classic slab paddling is on offer here. The first slab is a bit messy but the second, found 500m downstream, is a real classic! From here on, there is a mix of bedrock and boulders. A shallow drop forces a short portage where the river enters a mini-gorge. It gets steeper towards the end.

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">For those who like it steep: 200m of descent in 800m, this run is a bit like being poured down a rocky gutter – strangely satisfying.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A lot of water is abstracted into the aluminium smelter aqueduct at the put-in, so it needs to be wet for this one. The burn should be just bank-full, not raging, at the BP petrol station as you leave Fort William travelling north on the A82.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">On the A82 north of Fort William, turn right at Torlundy and right again to the North Face car park. Follow the well-graded forest tracks up the path towards Ben Nevis to the small intake dam. Egress below the final waterfall at the footbridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Initially the stream runs through a bouldery bed and is too small to paddle. After a while it starts to cut more of a channel and you can put on where you choose for a fun game of rock dodgems. Purists and those with new boats will carry further down, or just run away in tears. The first steeper section cuts into the bedrock with some ‘teacup’ drops – seal launch in river left halfway down. The bottom teacup is not much wider than a boat is long so might take some manoeuvring … be sure to boof out of here! After a flatter section the real fun begins. The gradient ramps up even more for a series of flumes, falls and slides, which amazingly all go. You may need to remove some wood, and watch out for any canyoning gear or participants. When the gradient relents there are two further jagged rapids that may go at some levels, then a picture-perfect clean 4m drop under the footbridge – lovely.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This creek has the distinction of draining the highest ground in Britain – the northern cliffs of Ben Nevis. Plus, it finishes at a whisky distillery. It is well worth walking in to the egress to inspect the bottom section before committing yourself to the carry uphill; you can huck the bottom drop at most levels.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The River Nevis flows through a spectacular glen and on into Loch Linnhe at Fort William, the centre of white-water kayaking on the west coast. At a high flow, the Upper Nevis is one of Lochaber’s test piece grade 5 runs: a rite of passage, giving entry into the ’big boys league’. There are few places on the run where you can afford to allow your concentration to slip from the task in hand and, until you are at the bottom of Polldubh Falls, your thoughts are constantly on what’s coming up next.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Typical Lochaber weather will bring the Nevis into good condition. The river comes up incredibly quickly, and in the frequent local monsoons it is often at or above a runnable level! In fact, if it’s raining hard, the level may change dramatically while you’re actually on the river. During the autumn and spring the Nevis runs frequently, but unfortunately not for long. It can be raging one afternoon, then dry the next morning. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">One option to judge the level is to look up Meall<br />an t-Suidhe, the hill at the foot of the glen, in front of Ben Nevis. If two or more of the ‘gauge burns’ are running then the river could be at a good level. Driving up the glen, it is easier to judge the flow once at Polldubh Falls. There should be enough water to float the easy stretch above the falls: no rocks showing at all and you are in for an exciting time. If it looks likely you won’t be able to control if you go down the left channel or right, maybe head elsewhere. A reading of 0.75 on the SEPA gauge should be considered an absolute minimum level and 1.2 should be considered the ‘ideal’ height, where everything is in prime condition. The higher it gets the more likely you’ll be cleaning your river shorts when you make it to the bank! </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Glen Nevis road is obvious from the roundabout by the Woollen Mill at the north end of Fort William on the A82. The road winds up the glen, crossing the river once at Polldubh Falls (NN 145 684). The take-out is just below these falls on river right. There is a large car park just before the bridge, and a few spaces right beside the fall. To reach the put-in, continue on up the glen to a car park at the end of the road. From here it’s on foot with your boat on your shoulder, following the path towards Steall<br />Falls. After 400m you cross a side stream via some steps cut into the rock. Turn off the trail onto a small path that leads down towards the river. You will arrive at the foot of the Steall Gorge, which is totally unrunnable. Get on as high up as you dare, it’s worth it.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Attempting a description of the first rapid, Boulder Blast (Gd 5), is useless. Suffice to say that it is probably the most continuous rapid of its grade in the area, with 300-400m of continuous carnage. The recent rockfall doesn’t appear to have changed things much. Several<br />lines are possible but a swim will hurt. To<br />give an idea of the length and complexity of boulder blast, a good line could be – start right, boof hard, stay right, boof hard, go middle, then left around the boulder, then back right of the island, boof twice, then left, then breathe. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From here the river is open and fast flowing, carrying you quickly to the start of the top gorge, signalled by the water pipe on river left. This gorge gets progressively harder and ends with Dave’s Hole (Gd 4+). Here the water pushes right, feeding you nicely into the hole and the ride of your life. In good levels it is best to hit the hole with speed on the right! At lower levels it can be avoided by heading left. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river now eases a little but beware, the infamous Scimitar Gorge (Gd 5) is soon upon you. If you have any sense you will have found this from the road and memorised both your run-in and line through the gorge, or your take-out eddy. It is a place that demands respect, with 3 difficult drops in quick succession. Note well the dangerous sump, which lies on river right on the 2nd drop. If you need to be told the line in this maelstrom of water, you shouldn’t be here! Once out at the bottom, don’t let the euphoria take over, you are not out of the woods yet!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Immediately after Scimitar you are faced with a multiple-choice test in The Narrows/Constriction. A couple of routes are available; boats have been stuck in a few of them! After this is Paddy’s drop, which lies under Paddy O’Hearn’s Bridge. In higher levels go left, in lower go right. Try to avoid the dodgy pocket on the left at the bottom of the hole, as it’s difficult to get out of and there is a siphon.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Good, continuous grade 4 water flushes you quickly through the Mad Mile. As the rock turns from grey to pink, it’s time to think of the next set of falls, unimaginatively named Leg Breaker after an incident at the annual sponsored river<br />race, raising money for the local Mountain Rescue Team, where competitors head down the river on lilos! A snappy roll may well come in useful if you flip at Leg Breaker (Gd 4+), as the next rapid, Dead Sheep (Gd 5), is not far below. The hole at the bottom is often kinder than it looks and surfs are generally short but violent! Run Dead Sheep on the right, but try not to smear yourself along the wall. At higher flows you can charge the rooster tail down the middle. Don’t switch off yet as the next narrow chute can sometimes trip you up.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river now relents for nearly 1km before a spectacular finish at Pollbudh Falls. A tricky<br />entry line in full view of a crowd of carnage-<br />hungry tourists offers a last chance to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. These falls have two chutes split by an island supporting the road bridge. It is wisest to run the main right-hand channel on the left. If you’re feeling good, throw a hammer or two for the spectators. The other chute, Spid’s Slot, has had descents, all unintentional and mostly backwards! Take out 50m downstream on river right. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At high flows it is worth checking the eddy above Scimitar Gorge before getting on if you plan to scout or portage it. Spid’s Slot isn’t recommended, and if you are here and backwards you’ve made a serious mistake! </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Lower Nevis winds its way down the glen from Polldubh Falls, meanders through the lower stretches of Glen Nevis and continues on into Fort William. After the maelstrom of the Upper Nevis, this section is all in a nice open glen with riffles and waves giving most of the excitement. There is, however, one major rapid near the bottom; portaging is simple.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">As for the Upper Nevis, the ‘gauge burns’ on Meall an t-Suidhe should both be visible for best results. A look over the A82 road bridge at the Woollen Mill in Fort William will give a good indication; few rocks – then go for it.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Turn off the A82 at the roundabout to the north of town next to the Woollen Mill. Follow the road up the glen passing an obvious rapid, the Roaring Mill after approximately 1 mile, and reaching Polldubh Falls after 4 more miles. The put-in is below Polldubh Falls on<br />river right at a small eddy. The best egress point is from the large pool below the Roaring<br />Mill, although it is also possible to kayak<br />further down the river and into Loch Linnhe.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Putting in below the falls, the river is in a small gorge for a very limited time with several small waves and ledges. Have a look in the big eddy on the right; this is often where lost gear from the upper section turns up! The banks soon fall away and you are left in the open glen with the river rushing on towards the sea. There are lots of places to practise ferry gliding and eddy turns. The new Visitor Centre passes by, and soon the noise and spray warns of the approaching Roaring Mill (Gd 4). Inspection here is necessary and portaging is easy on the left bank. This makes a good end to the trip as the last 2km are more of the same, but without the scenic views. If you continue into town be aware that as the Nevis drops into Loch Linnhe, there is a man-made weir that has a formidable towback in some conditions, but is washed out completely when the tide is high. At the right levels the ‘legendary’ Nevis Wave forms.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">When the river is very high, trees start to crowd the eddies, making breakouts and rescue more difficult. In these conditions make sure you scout the take-out above Roaring Mill and get out in plenty of time if you don’t intend to paddle it.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Park in the forestry car park on the right before you get to Polldubh. From here walk up the path on the river left. Keep going until you see a big horrible looking drop that looks <br />unrunnable (it is), this is the get-off. From here keep going up the track until you reach the fire road, then walk down the bank from the bend in the road till you find Sonic Slabs. You’ll know them when you see them. Further rapids do lie up the glen, and will be worth the explore if you have the energy.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Joining the Nevis below Polldubh, this run is fast, shallow and lots of fun. The main features are the Sonic Slabs, named for the supersonic<br />speed you’ll be going at the bottom, and a twisty bouncy rapid. The big slides both go making this run a hidden gem. Hitting the wall in the twisty rapid isn’t as bad as you’d think! Get off before falling down the messy 20m fall which lands on rocks. If the Upper Nevis is too high, this is definitely worth the effort.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Kiachnish flows from Lochan Lunn Da-Bhra (Lundavra), entering Loch Linnhe 3 miles south of Fort William. It is a great run, on a par with, but slightly easier than, the Upper Nevis. Beginning in an open glen, with a mixture of bedrock and boulders, the river then enters a steep-sided wooded gorge with good bedrock rapids. The last part of the river is less steep, and the rapids become more shingly towards the end. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river below the dam at the start of the run should have very few rocks showing, but if it’s brown and bank full, the gorge might be a bit full-on. As a rough guide if the Nevis is running at a high level the Kiachnish should be runnable.&#160;</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving north on the A82, you will cross the River Kiachnish 3 miles before Fort William. To get to the put-in, turn right at the roundabout as you enter Fort William (signposted to Upper Achintore). Follow this road, which soon becomes single track, until once again you can see the river and&#160;hydro dam off to your right. Park at the large lay-by just before you pass the dam. Take out back at the bridge over the A82.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The fun begins with a 1m ledge drop. From here, the next 1.5km is really good grade 3/4 paddling, best at a high flow when the odd river-wide hole spices things up. The river then eases to grade 2/3 for another 1.5km, until a tributary joins on river right (NN 094 687). Take care at the small weir just downstream which has some metal-work protruding from it. Barbed wire can be a hazard here. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Those who have enjoyed this stretch but don’t fancy the gorge below can carry up through the fields on river right to the road. The gorge starts with a good grade 4 and the rapids come thick and fast. It should be considered 4+ at high flows and could contain the odd tree. Scouting and portaging is generally straightforward and you should always be able to climb out if required. An extremely narrow slot stands out as being worth protecting (Gd 5). </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Some 200m below this comes the biggest fall on the river. Scout/portage this one on river left. Two lines are possible, the left being the most likely. Beware of the pinning potential on this drop, as there is an old fish ladder here. The river now eases to grade 3, but keep your wits about you as one last grade 4/5 waits for the unwary. The hole at the bottom of this one is a bit ‘grippy’! From here it is a straight-<br />forward paddle to the take-out with the<br />exception of a fence across the river which could be dangerous at high flows.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A hydro scheme was constructed in 2017. The river still goes in high flows but there will be fewer paddleable days.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river is found by the A830 at the small village of Fassfern approximately 6 miles west of Fort William. This scenic glen offers some nice boating and some long walking. The Fassfern, or An t-Súileag to give it its Gaelic name, is a mainly bedrock run, with clean rock slides and tree-lined banks. There is on-going bank erosion and there are often trees obstructing the run.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Despite the hydro scheme, this still seems to run ok when the Nevis is a little too high. Standing on the road bridge in the village looking upstream, the riverbed above the bridge is open and boulder strewn. The river is low but runnable, even if only a handful of the largest boulders are visible. If all that can be seen is bouncy water then the grades go up and the lower section becomes continuous.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From Fort William take the A82 north before turning off onto the A830. After approximately<br />6 miles a small sign points right towards<br />Fassfern. Stop just over the bridge in the large car park. The road up the left side of the river before the bridge is a private road and is usually locked. If the gate is open the chances are that there is work going on. Taking a vehicle in here may result in it being locked in, possibly overnight. The only option is to walk up on river left. A brisk 30/40 minute walk brings you to a bridge over the river; 100m further on is a small mountain stream that crosses the road, this is your access point. Take out directly below the road bridge on the right.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Straight from the put-in stream the river immerses you in its intensity with a series of small bedrock ledges that bring you out at Tango (Gd 5-). This fall is the hardest rapid in the lower section and can give a variety of<br />interesting lines. The collection pool below this is huge, so any detritus is easily gathered<br />before progressing further. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river is now bubbling along merrily and some swift moving grade 2 brings you to your next mission, 7-UP (Gd 4-). This rapid is the longest one and as such deserves respect. The tricky start is followed by seven small ledges, the idea being to ‘play’ in each ledge. The river now wanders off with a couple of innocuous rapids. The next horizon line shows, as you<br />approach it, a large roostertail. Running just to the right of this will land you in the hole at the bottom of Slider (Gd 4-). </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Just around the corner from here a chute brings you into the home straight. The last horizon line before the road bridge gives Backwards Slab (Gd 4). As the name suggests this is begging to be run backwards; failure to do so brings bad ‘Juju’ for the rest of your paddling trip. It is only a short way to the road bridge and its own rapid of grade 3. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Most people take out river right below the bridge. Alternatively, just around the corner downstream is Master Blaster (Gd 4+); this has a big towback on the left side, beware! It is possible to run this and continue on down to the sea, where the main road crosses the river. There is one more rapid on this stretch.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The upper river can also be paddled after heavy rain, but due to the long walk-in is not so regularly run. This section of water is much more continuous, and has one possible portage. There is a year-round culling programme that is in operation on the Fassfern estate and as such there is always the possibility that you could be mistaken for a deer and shot. There are more adventures than just paddling here.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A hydro scheme has been constructed on the Fassfern. Although it doesn’t go as often as it used to, it’s still worth a look if it’s bucketing down. Watch out for the dam if you paddle the upper stretch.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Fionn Lighe flows into the west end of Loch Eil close to where the A861 branches off the A830, Fort William to Mallaig road. Yet another spate run on the north side of Loch Eil, this river has some nice grade 4 water, and one or two dodgy rock formations.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the take-out, the river should look high, bank full and fast flowing. This is not a good river to try and scrape down.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the river, drive west on the A830 towards Mallaig. About a mile after the end of Loch Eil you will cross the river. Parking is available at the end of the track on your right, beside an old bridge. Walk up on a good track for about 2km, to where a footbridge crosses the river. Put on here.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the put-in bridge, the first 500m is easy going grade 3. The rapids start to pick up until<br />the first major challenge is reached (Gd 5). This is a dog-leg that moves from left to right. As the river starts to drop into a small gorge there is a slightly ugly 2m fall into a slot which is easily portaged. The rapid exiting the large pool below here has a nasty sump lurking<br />below the water. Take care! This is followed by a 3m river-wide ledge creating a stopper with a strong towback. More interesting rapids<br />follow, with the final kilometre being a gentler grade 3.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The long finger of Loch Eil points west from Fort William. Just short of the historic landmark of Glenfinnan, the river Dubh Lighe drains south from the mountain of Streap. A little-run river in a quiet neck of the woods, the Dubh Lighe is a great trip, which is often ‘in nick’. Stretches of flat water and a couple of portages do not spoil what is a fun river, with a surprising number of good rapids.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Although wet weather is required, the Dubh Lighe does not require as much water as many other spate rivers. It could be a good bet if<br />other trips aren’t quite in full flow. That said, the river has a rattly feel at lower levels and is definitely better after some good rain. All the rocks upstream of the road bridge should be covered with a good flow right up to the banks to signal that a runnable flow has been reached. If the river is very full and flowing powerfully, other options could be considered.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Take the A830 from Fort William. About 2 miles beyond the junction with the A861 you cross the river. Take an immediate right and park at the foot of the track that leads up the glen. Walk up a good forest road to the put-in. Just when you are getting hot and sweaty (after 2km), take the right-hand fork which drops quickly down to the river at a bridge crossing a narrow gorge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The narrow gorge at the put-in contains a couple of drops. The first of these needs to be scouted, and it could be worth doing this<br />before you get on at the top of the gorge. This drop has some pinning potential, but goes fine at the right level (Gd 5). If you don’t fancy this harsh start you can eddy out a few metres above the constriction and make a short portage on river left, regaining the river by a narrow gully just above a nice 1m ledge. Just as the first gorge ends, you need to keep a good look out for a sump lurking in the middle of the river! A nasty configuration of boulders is a trap for the unwary paddler in an otherwise innocuous looking rapid. This ugly feature is covered at higher levels. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There now follows some really sweet water with a couple of ‘engaging’ drops which make for some nice boating (Gd 4/5). This section is all quite runnable, mainly from the boat, with 1 or 2 spots that may require extra care. Easier water leads to the lower section where the character of the river changes and the nice stuff is mixed up with a ‘bit of rough’. This change is signalled by a tree blockage just above an equally blocked fall (portage both at once and seal launch on river left). Further downstream, a 2m fall ends with a nasty pothole completely enclosing the plunge pool, with most of the water sumping through underneath! Yuck! If you paddle this be sure to boof.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The next 4m fall is onto rocks and can be portaged on river right, clambering down into the gorge just above a nice hole. Despite the portages, the paddling is still fun as you pick and choose between that which you fancy and that which you don’t. Don’t miss out on the last clean 4m fall, which is a real hoot.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Abhainn Shlatach drops steeply into Glenfinnan, next to the A830, known locally as ‘The Road to the Isles’. The river offers two sections, both quite short: an open upper run with a couple of classy multi-stage drops and a<br />lower gorge with some messy slabs set among overhanging rhododendrons! No prizes for guessing which is the favoured stretch. A new dam is proposed which may affect the flow in future.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Just upstream of Glenfinnan there is an ugly weir that separates the two stretches of river. This is just a short walk down the track that leaves the A830 just beyond the village and before the bridge over the railway. At a good flow for the upper section, the river should be bank full, with the rocks just downstream of the weir covered. Basically, lots and lots of water is needed! If the river looks just about floatable, then the lower section would be the more suitable choice.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the upper put-in, drive west on the A830 from Glenfinnan; the drops on the river<br />are easily visible from the road. After just over ½ a mile, the river flattens off and there is room on the north side of the road to park. Just don’t get run over by a train on the short walk to the river. The run is split in two by the weir, described above, which serves as a useful put-in and take-out point. The take-out for the lower section can be found by turning right at the foot of the hill in Glenfinnan. Follow the road past the hotel and find a spot to park near the bridge or pier at the loch side.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Flat water soon leads to the first fall, which gets much better with more water. Stretches of braided and flat water continue for another kilometre, interrupted by some long ‘full-on’ bedrock rapids; definitely worth a scout in places. At one point you have to make a committed move above a nasty roostertail. Directly<br />below here the river splits round another<br />island; both channels have good white water. Take care not to be swept into the ugly weir already mentioned. Portage river left. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Below the weir you are quickly into the lower gorge. The first major horizon is a large jaggy fall – one to walk. At higher flows the ledge below here has a large hole! The last twisting slab has several options, all of which may involve some tangling with the rhodies! Take care if you are scouting this fall from river left; you might be straying into someone’s back garden.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Ailort flows from Loch Eilt into Loch Ailort, about 10 miles beyond Glenfinnan, on the Fort William to Mallaig road. This is a short paddle of only 2km, but continually interesting – much better than a casual sighting from the A830 would suggest.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Although a small river, which needs to be reasonably high, the Ailort is loch fed and holds water well. The river flows close to the road just after leaving Loch Eilt and levels can be checked here. Most rocks should be well covered if the river is to be worth paddling. This is a great run at huge flows, when it may be considered a good grade harder, and is a good option if you’ve run away from all the other local burns.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Access is via a short carry from one of the roadside parking places at the west end of Loch Eilt. It is a simple and short carry with your boat from the car to the river. To find the take-out, drive downstream and turn left just after the hotel in Lochailort, onto the A861. Cross the river, then take a left just before the almost derelict Loch Ailort House. Continue upstream a short distance until a convenient parking place and egress from the river coincide.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There is a broken weir shortly after the start, which provides the most difficult part of the trip. It is easy to inspect, and an obvious line presents itself. Shortly after this, a couple of steep grade 3s may prove a touch rocky but are straightforward from an upright perspective. The river progresses with several rapids, chutes and generally interesting paddling. Most of the easy water flows well and passes quickly. A small weir in the lower stretch, marked by a footbridge, has a nasty towback at some levels, and is worth scouting.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Although a small river and a short paddle, this is an enjoyable trip in its own right. It would also make a great second river when daylight does not make a longer paddle a sensible option, or a superb summer evening paddle when water levels allow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a popular salmon fishing river so a small discreet group would definitely be the way to go. The tributary joining river left near the take-out, the <span class="Pesda-Bold--Emphasis-">Allt a’ Bhuiridh</span>, has some eye-popping steep drops that only those way beyond rational thought will attempt.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Irine Burn flows into the sea at Roshven, in between Glenuig and Lochailort. A short but steep blast with some significant (and some unrunnable) waterfalls, this river is well worth a look if you’re in the area.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This run needs rain, but not too much; the San-bag Burn and Shlatach will both be running too. A new hydro scheme affects the levels but in high water still leaves plenty to paddle. The rapids just upstream of the road bridge at the take-out should look more or less runnable. If in doubt run up and have a quick look at some of the drops upstream.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Around 4 miles west of Lochailort on the A861, you will come to a bridge over the Irine burn where the hydro power house can be clearly seen. Park up carefully where you can and hike up the dirt track by the side of the river. The gate at the bottom was unlocked when we ran it. We put on just below the intake weir, but there may well be decent drops upstream of this. Take out river left where the fence meets each side of the river before the monster portage.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The first few rapids below the weir are slightly rocky but straightforward. Watch out for debris and iron reinforcing bars sticking out of the river-<br />bed. At the horizon line, hop out on river right to inspect Boof or Cry, which looks fun (3m and vertical), but a little shallow: make your own mind up. Another rocky looking slide below this is actually smooth and clean. Soon you reach a right-hand bend; inspect from river left. The top half of the rapid looks messy (we portaged), but the lower half is great. Banana Split gives the choice of two lines split by a rock down the middle. The curved line down the right shoots you straight into the pool at the bottom. After<br />a short blast down the next small drop, a left-hand bend leads you to a narrow slot which may warrant protection in higher water. When you see the fence meet both river banks, take out on river left. The drops below (5, 13 then 5m) mostly land on rock – the bottom one may go but looked too much hassle to get to. From here, carry your boat back down to the car and enjoy the views to Arisaig and the Small Isles.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If you’re not feeling up to the main section or want a warm up, these three or four drops make a pleasant short stunt.

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Since the previous edition, this has become a bit of a flagship waterfall run.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Recent rain is required. It is hard to see the river from the A82 road bridge so park up and check. A decent flow under the bridge is required.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the A82, there is an easy to find car park next to Vertical Descents. A network of footpaths allows you to inspect/access the run. Get out when you’ve had enough, or float to the road bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Abhainn Righ, also known as Inchree Falls or Injury Falls, flows into Loch Linnhe at Inchree, some 8 miles south of Fort William. If you really need to run the slide, it’s best done in huge flows as it has claimed more than one vertebra, and more water might cushion you a bit. This long slide requires little actual kayaking<br /> skill, but looks impressive as hell. Following the slide is a 12m fall which goes cleanly in higher flows, and makes a cracking photo. Following the large fall are a few more drops and a slot that you might want to portage. It’s probably worth it for everything that comes after the slide. A great park and huck on your way back to the Fort from Glencoe.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Flowing into Loch Linnhe on the opposite shore to Fort William, the Abhainn Sron a’ Chreagain is a steep and narrow run with good bedrock slabs, that eases in its lower half.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Best when high, catch this run if you can – it drops off quickly! The shingle rapids upstream of the road bridge should be paddleable with water to spare.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Coming from Fort William take the A830 towards Mallaig. At the head of Loch Eil turn left onto the A861 for Strontian. Opposite Fort William you will come to a river (NN 071 725). Park in the lay-by just before the bridge and follow the path upstream on river left. After about 1.5km the path begins to peter out and it is time to drop down to the river. You could start higher up, but the best white water is now below you. Take out above or below the drop under the road bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Initially the river is narrow with bedrock rapids<br />and overhanging trees. You soon come to a good steep section, which at high flows would be pushing grade 5. A gnarly folding fall where the river S-bends is worth scouting. This fall is easy to check during the walk-in, as it’s close to the path. From here the river is a little less steep overall, but there are still a couple of eye openers. The drop under the road bridge is the sting in the tail. It looks a bit unfeasible but seems to go OK.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If the last fall looks beyond your abilities you might find the upper stretch a struggle.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A good diversion if you’re passing by or looking for something different, yet still easy to reach from the A82 via the Corran Ferry, the Scaddle has three main rapids, the last being the biggest. Flowing into Loch Linnhe opposite the Kiachnish, this run needs plenty of water; however it has a large catchment and can become a wide, high-volume 4+ run reminiscent of the Orchy. Watch out for holes! Drive north from the Corran Ferry then drive or walk 1km up Glen Scaddle to where the valley flattens out under the wooden bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Well worth the effort on a wet day, the more water the better. The Cona Glen just to the north looks promising on the map but has no rapids of note in its lower course.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is the river that runs east from the pass between Strontian and Loch Linnhe. A short fun trip with convenient road access, it is handy if you are on the far side of the loch and there is a lot of water around.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A section of the old road runs next to the river and this makes it very easy to check out the run before getting on. This is to be recommended, as the main drop would be awkward to scout once on the water. The river will need to be fairly full for this run to be anything<br />other than a rock-fest.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the Corran Ferry, drive south on the A861. Just past the junction with the B8043 the road turns inland. Half a mile beyond this junction, the main road crosses a small stream and it is possible to turn left onto the stretch of old road mentioned above. This is the take-out. You could put in anywhere convenient further up the A861, or alternatively make use of the old stretch of road to drive the short distance upstream.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A very small river, the Tarbert flows fast and flat over shingle rapids for most of its journey down the glen. The last kilometre of the river<br />is contained in a small gorge, which hides some grade 4 water. The rapids are very tight and, if the river is only just high enough, they will involve a fair amount of rock contact. As the gorge narrows the crux of the run appears. This 2m fall is slightly blocked in nature and requires a committed move to avoid the cliff on the left (Gd 4+).</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This short trip is worth combining with something else. Perhaps the Blackwater, the Abhainn Sron a’ Chreagain or the Abhainn na Coinnich. If this run looks harder than you fancy, you might want to check out the Carnoch River which flows down the west side of the pass towards Strontian.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a hidden gem of a river, full of interest and charm, that rarely comes into condition; when it does it is very much worth it. The river<br />starts life winding its way through heather-<br />lined banks, but soon picks up gradient. Before long you arrive at the only rapid of note (Gd 4), a little narrow bedrock slot/drop move, easily recognisable as the rest of the river is a continuous boulder garden. More grade 4 continues for the next couple of kilometres before gently easing through the grades down to the egress bridge. Watch out for trees.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This river flows out from Garbh Bheinn mountain. It contains steep bedrock slides in the upper river, but a short sweet section of white water exists just before its confluence with the Tarbert. Park at the old bridge over the river, next to the road. Walk in along the path until the river flattens, and get in where you like. Bank full is the ideal level.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Abhainn na Coinnich drains the small Loch Uisge in Ardgour and runs east into Loch Linnhe. It is a cracking little river that lies well off the beaten track. Steep and rocky in its upper reaches, the Coinnich feels very much like a mountain burn. In its lower half the river has more power with stoppers and holes providing the main challenge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A new hydro scheme at the end of Loch Uisge means that a bigger flow will be required to bring the run into condition. Big spates should remain unaffected so if it’s wet enough to bring the Coe into good nick, this could still be worth a look. Check the flow where the river first drops down to the road from Loch Uisge. This is perhaps the rockiest section and you should be able to tell if you have enough water from here.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Drive south from the Corran Ferry on the A861. Take the left turn at Inversanda and follow the minor road along the shore, an adventure in itself. At Loch a Choire, the road heads inland and as you leave the forest at Kingairloch House, you can see the river to your left. Carry on upstream to check the level as described above and park by the shore of Loch Uisge. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The trip ends at the bridge at Kingairloch House. The road into the estate is private and the easiest way to avoid getting into trouble is to carry the boats a short distance back upstream to the public road. Follow the path round the estate buildings, through the forest and up to the public road where there is a gate and passing place.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Paddle across the loch to its eastern end where a rocky weir marks the start of the trip. Hold on tight as you are straight away into the section that you saw from the road, and it will probably be steeper than you had expected! Take care as the river swings east down the valley, a large 3-tier waterfall (Gd 5) comes up quickly. The remains of a fish ladder lurk below the water on the 3rd drop so swimmers should keep their legs up! One more steep boulder strewn rapid on this upper stretch takes some thinking about, before easier water leads to the forest edge. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A long section of grade 3/4 starts at a footbridge and gets more exciting as it goes. A tree wedged high above the river gives warning of a water level best avoided and marks the start of the best rapids. Scouting here is awkward but not to worry, everything goes at about grade 4/4+, with a couple of holes that you will want to punch. Keep a good eye out for trees, as there is some debris in and around the river. A rhododendron tunnel leads to the bridge and take-out.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Please try not to upset the occupants of Kingairloch House, who may be a little surprised to look out of the kitchen window and see you emerging from ‘their’ river. Small groups and a low profile will work best.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Blackwater changes character along its length, with peaceful flat water leading to full-on bedrock falls and a final continuous bouldery gorge. It runs in a loop away from the road and gives a feeling of isolation very different from the popular runs of the Fort William area. Expert paddlers who want to do something ‘a little different’ will have a great time on this one.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river needs a lot of rain, but don’t wait for flood conditions as the gorge section at the end could be a little too exciting at very high flows. At the take-out, the river is less confined and should look a little bony, but with enough water to float between the rocks.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving south from Fort William on the A82, take the Corran Ferry across Loch Linnhe, then turn left and drive towards Acharacle. Take the left turn onto the A884 towards Lochaline. About a mile past the turn-off to Kingairloch, the tributaries of the Blackwater can be seen coming together on your right. To reach the put-in, park at the top of the hill before the road turns away from the river, and walk down the steep hillside. To get to the take-out and check the flow, continue towards Lochaline. Just as the river comes back to the road, there is a turn-off to the right which leads to a house. There is plenty of room to park before the old stone bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the put-in, the river is almost completely flat for about 4km, with a wilderness feel and plenty of deer and bird life. You’ll be starting to wonder if there’s any white water on the river at all, when you come cross the first rapid, Out of the Blue (Gd 5). A short run-in leads to an obvious horizon line and a steep shallow ramp into a boily pool. A potential pinning spot, this rapid warrants careful inspection. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river now eases again until you reach the next major grade 5, Black Beauty, marked by a bridge over the river. Inspect/portage on river left. This is the start of the white water proper. A fun grade 4 section quickly leads to Primrose Falls, a serious set of drops that may go at the right level, although protection would be difficult. Portage river left. After the falls, the water is continuously interesting. You need to be on top of your game as the banks steepen through this final section. Some precision eddy-<br />hopping is required to make sure you don’t get swept into one of several trees lodged in the gorge. Some can be avoided, while others <br />require portaging. We managed this at river level. As the gorge walls drop away, a stone bridge appears which marks the take-out.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Although most of the paddling is grade 4, the river holds considerable hazard. With more than a handful of ‘must make’ eddies, this is not a place for a large or inexperienced group. If you can’t see what’s coming next, make sure you get out and look! If you wish to inspect the river before you commit or just want to paddle the last 2km, which has most of the action, there’s a track which leads up from the take-out on river left. Paddling from the top does however give the trip a special wilderness feel.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a beautiful little river containing some lovely hidden white water in an open glen. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The first rapid just visible from the road wants to be floatable either side of the boulder leading into the main rapid.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If you are driving the A884 to Lochaline, the access is where the river first gets closest to the road next to the farm track bridge over the river. Take out just over 3km down the road when the river is alongside the road again but before it goes away from the river for 500m. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the get-in there is a couple of hundred metres of flat water to warm up before the first rapid, Popsicle (Gd 4); pick your lead in line, accelerate down the ramp and through the hole at the bottom. The river then eases<br />before soon leading you into Sphincter, a<br />lovely grade 4 rapid that picks up speed all the way along until firing you out at the bottom. More grade 2 water continues before the next test, Orange Peanuts (Gd 4); this rapid has a choice of lines – pick the one of least resistance. This leads straight into the Lost City of Atlantis, a fantastic looking 4-part rapid in an almost unprotectable little gorge, which may be paddleable. You can portage either side and, with difficulty, put back on just below. It is then an interesting read and run grade 3 easing to grade 2 before getting the egress.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This section of the river is a gorgeous run in an open glen, well worth the walk if you are up for it.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Look over the downstream side of the bridge in Strontian. If all the rocks are at least just covered, then trip will be on.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Drive down the Pollock road alongside the<br />river, taking the right-hand fork to the Ariundle<br />forestry car park. Unload and carry your boat along the track until it starts climbing, then take the right-hand fork just through the big gate at the other end of the reserve and walk on down to the river. Take out at the bridge over the river just behind the Church of Scotland or continue on down the lower section.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river soon picks up and you enter an open gorge which contains Bubble Bath (Gd 4). An unusual hole/slot at the exit directly under a wire fence can be worth inspecting to check it’s clear. Once in the pool below you are directly into Thunderballs (Gd 4+), a fantastic steep boulder garden. Gradually easing, you soon arrive at an island; river left is a very narrow and steep line containing pinning potential, river right is a large 5m fall directly onto rock. Portage easily river right before re-entering the river 50m downstream. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Continue on down, enjoying more grade 3/4 water. You pass under two footbridges, once past the second one the river flattens out and there are a couple of kilometres of gentle<br />water. There’s a weir which has been paddled at lower levels and a fence to negotiate. The get-out bridge will soon appear or alternatively<br />continue on down to the sea.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If you don’t want the flat paddle out you can egress at the second forestry footbridge and walk back to your car.</p>

			<p class="Section-heading">Glen Spean</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Spean is by far the biggest river in this ‘neck of the woods’. It offers paddling at all water levels. In even the driest conditions you can enjoy navigating the narrow bedrock channels of the Spean Gorge and in times of extreme flood there is plenty of action to be had on the Upper Spean as the Laggan Dam releases its watery load. The many tributaries of the Spean also provide great runs. The Roy is the most popular, and deservedly so<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> but check out the Treig and Cour, fantastic in the right water<br />conditions. The villages of Roy and Spean Bridge are a good base for kayaking operations with a choice of bunkhouses, campsites and chalets for accommodation. The Commando Bar is a favourite watering hole and a good place to warm your toes in front of the fire.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>Many of the north-flowing rivers plus the Spean itself were harnessed by </span><span xml:lang="en-US">a major </span><span>hydro</span><span xml:lang="en-US">-<br /></span><span>electric scheme in the 1920s to provide power for the aluminium smelter </span><span xml:lang="en-US">being built in </span><span>Fort William. This comprise</span><span xml:lang="en-US">s </span><span>two large dams on the Spean and the Treig, plus the main tunnel,<br />which was until 1970 the longest water-<br />carrying tunnel in the world, at 15 miles long. What this means for the white</span><span xml:lang="en-US">-</span><span>water<br />kayaker is that these rivers generally need a lot of rain or snowmelt to run. Furthermore the classic intermediate trip</span><span xml:lang="en-US">,</span><span> the Pattack, up until now free-running, is currently having a dam installed in its headwaters. Whether we will see scheduled releases, as promised, remains to be seen.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Tucked away in the Upper Spey valley, this burn flows south to join the Spey at Garva Bridge. This is a classic spate burn with a good selection of bedrock and boulder rapids. There are several nice drops and mini<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>gorges that will give either a fun but rocky bounce, or a full-on day out, depending on water level.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Feith Talagain has only a small catchment area above the put-in, so it will probably need to be raining on the day to make it ‘a go’. Just before the river joins the Spey there is a hard, twisting fall. This makes a good place to judge the flow, but don’t be put off, the rest of the river is nicer than this one! Make sure there is enough water to float the boulder section just upstream.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Turn off the A86 at Laggan and follow the minor road to where it ends at Garva Bridge. This is part of General Wade’s road, a communication network built in an attempt to subdue the Jacobite forces. The road degenerates into a rough track from this point<span xml:lang="en-US">. </span>Leaving cars at the bridge over the Spey, it’s a short walk to the river. If the water level looks OK, cross the bridge and continue upstream. It’s probably best to follow the forest track up the hill, skirt the edge of the forest and contour across the boggy hillside. After 2km a tributary (NN 540 967) marks a flattening in the river and a good spot to put in.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The first steepening marks a nice series of drops starting with a 1m boof ledge. A clean 4m fall and a double slab make some really nice boating. Next comes the main event, which comprises a couple of 5m ramps. At big flows this comes complete with a weird rooster tail and a very large hole! The action continues with more drops and chutes before a kilometre of easy water to the bridge. Already mentioned is the unappealing nature of the rapid below the bridge, but if you do decide to run it, watch out for the water sumping out under the boulder in the right-hand chute.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Expert paddlers who run this river at high flows will have a real stonker of a trip and find it’s good grade 5 action almost all the way!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A decent introduction to walk-in ‘creek boating’ for intermediates, this run has some lively water in a low gorge, but is never too serious. You’ll need a good bit of water: other rivers like the Roy will be running. Walk up the track, river left, from below the Spey Dam. Put on wherever you fancy. Don’t paddle it thinking you are on the Feith Talagain, like we did, constantly thinking there will be ‘gnar’ just around the next corner. There isn’t.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Flowing into Loch Laggan and thence down the Spean, the Pattack drains from the northern slopes of Ben Alder. This is a good intermediate trip, with many fine grade 3+ rapids and a couple of harder sections that can be easily portaged. Unfortunately, a hydro dam is under construction further upstream at<br />approximately NN 549 832.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Once the dam is completed, it will need to be very wet for this trip to be on, unless, as promised, the hydro company reduces their generating capacity on certain days to let the natural flow return. Information on releases will be posted on the SCA website. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The </span><span xml:lang="en-US">final </span><span>rapid drops into a pool beside the A86, Spean Bridge to Kingussie road, at a popular picnic spot close to the upper end of Loch Laggan. If there is enough water to run this rapid the trip will be on. If this rapid is pumping, expect a very fast trip. At these flows the smaller rapids become washed out, and the trip is only worthwhile if you intend to run the main rapids. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the take-out, follow the A86 to the picnic spot mentioned above, some 24 miles east of Spean Bridge, where there is a large Forestry Commission car park. To get to the put-in, drive back towards Spean Bridge. After about a mile, park in a lay-by opposite a farm track and walk the 2km up this track past the farmyard to a locked gate at the edge of the forest. An obvious small path leads down to the river. Alternatively, you could try your luck at the estate office, which is another ½ mile back towards Spean Bridge on the right-hand side (NN 547 897). If you ask them in advance they will normally provide you with the combination to the lock on the bottom gate to allow vehicular access, on condition that vehicles are not left at the put-in. The estate office phone number is 01528 544300, or email<br />ardverikie@ardverikie.com.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The path from the forest gate brings you to the top of a steep gully. From here it is possible to scramble down to the river at the bottom of the Falls of Pattack (Gd 5). If you are silly enough to wish to paddle this 10m monstrosity, follow the path upstream and choose your put-in. At low flows the pool at the bottom of the falls is shallow, at higher flows the run<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>in becomes progressively more interesting, but at least the pool fills up (a little). </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From below the falls, the river is grade 3 for the first kilometre, with lots of small drops and eddy lines to enjoy. A horizon line warns of the first <span xml:lang="en-US">grade 4</span> rapid, marked as ‘waterfall’ on the OS map<span xml:lang="en-US">. T</span>his can be run down either side at most flows. The river then returns to grade 3 with some more nice playspots. The sides of the river begin to rise as you approach the first gorge. Despite a feeling of impending doom, the rapids get no harder and the river banks soon open out again. However, you are now not far from the second gorge (Gd 4). This contains 4 really sweet rapids, finishing in the drop seen from the road. The stopper here is shallow and isn’t quite as bad as it at first seems. There is a good path on river right from which to inspect the drops. If you don’t fancy them, it’s only a short walk back to the picnic area.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Please don’t attempt to drive up the access road without first getting permission. The guys at the estate here have been very supportive of paddlers and are happy to help. Let’s all make sure it stays that way.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This river runs out of Lochan na h-earba into Loch Laggan, close to Ardverikie Castle, featured in the TV series Monarch of the Glen. Park in the Creag Meagaidh car park, off the A86 Roybridge to Newtonmore road (NN 483 873; 56.9519, -4.4955), and then paddle over Loch Laggan to the river left (west) side of the burn. This may be hard to spot because of fallen trees. From the top, the river is mainly grade 3/4 until a good 500m section of grade 4 leads to a rocky grade 5, which may be a portage. After that more grade 4 rocky action leads to a stone bridge. It actually got dark then so we never got to paddle the steep slabby drops that lead back to the loch.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allt Coire Ardair flows down the main U-shaped valley on the southern side of Creag Meagaidh and drains into Loch Laggan. This is a fast, continuous spate run, with little time to catch your breath or admire the stunning scenery.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">You need maximum flows for this one. The<br />river should look bank full, with all but the larger boulders covered.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Turn off the A86 Spean Bridge to Laggan road at the hill walkers’ car park for Creag Meagaidh. Carry up the obvious walking track on the right side of the glen (river left). Put in as the valley starts to level out. Take out above the braided lower section and follow the path back to your car.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This run is made up of bedrock slabs strewn with boulders over a steady gradient. There’s one ledge which stands out and may create a large river-wide hole. Not far below this, there is a steep and slightly rocky slab. Otherwise it’s a very simple recipe: strap your boat to your back for a hike into a beautiful location and crash out of control back down again. Once on the move you might drag in a few holes, but otherwise it’s all go till the end.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Abhainn Ghuilbinn feeds into Loch Laggan on its south side. Although it is possible to walk up from the bottom and run the lower gorges, the whole river is better paddled in conjunction with the River Ossian. Run in its entirety, the Ghuilbinn is a tremendous trip. It starts from Loch Ghuilbinn with a long boulder field that cheers the soul. After a small upper gorge the river opens then hurtles through a couple of technical drops and so out onto the flat. A lower gorge follows and to cap the day off, the ugliest fall is saved until last.<br />Sadly, this river too now has a hydro scheme on its lower reaches.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A prolonged period of heavy rain is generally required to get this river at its best. With less water, it is possible to have a good day out in the lower gorges, but the longer trip will feel like a slog. The only way to gauge the flow on the Ghuilbinn is by walking in from the A86 and looking at the last large fall on the river. If this fall has very few rocks showing it may be worth considering the full run. If there is a choice of chutes, many of which do not run, the lower gorge is probably the only option. It is unknown how the new hydro scheme<br />affects the ‘paddleability’.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The lower gorges can be accessed from a large lay-by on the A86, close to Moy Cottage, where a bridge crosses the narrow neck of Loch Laggan. Follow the track across the bridge and turn left before the houses, to reach the Abhainn Ghuilbinn. Walk up the right bank until the river goes flat. You are now above the lower gorges. For details of the upper put-in, see the Ossian description. After the trip, paddle across the loch and back up the channel to your car.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Loch Ghuilbinn exits into easy water that is a nice warm up for the section to come. After about <span xml:lang="en-US">a kilometre</span> the flow picks up to give a long section of good grade 3 paddling. A short section of flat precedes the first horizon line, Acid House (Gd 4). Soon after this is the start of the first gorge. The two entry falls are close together (Gd 5), and the second is undercut at the bottom. The last rapid in the gorge is a hoot and goes by the name of The Drainpipe (Gd 4+). Run the first hole then collect your thoughts to boof the pour-over ledge. Failure to make this line spells trouble. There is however a large pool for flotsam to gather in, if you manage to escape the stopper. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">A kilometre </span><span>of easier paddling is followed by the bottom gorge, which is best inspected. A couple of sweet drops bring you to the main event, a twisting undercut 3m fall. The main chute has been run at grade 5+, although a much <br />friendlier chicken chute is fair game at high flows. From here, a short paddle brings you to the last delight: a set of fragmented slabs with many routes, but only one or two real possibilities. There are a couple of nasty sumps which are not obvious at high flows. From here it is an arduous (read flat) paddle down to the loch, and then across to the A86. </span><span xml:lang="en-US">This is t</span><span>ruly one of the great adventure paddles in Scotland.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There is a stalker’s track along the left side of the Ghuilbinn which will be easier to use than the bank if you are in difficulty. More water will undoubtedly raise the grades of some of the rapids on the Ghuilbinn.</p>

This is really the first half of a two</span><span xml:lang="en-US">-</span><span>river journey from Rannoch Moor to Glen Spean via the River Ossian and Abhainn Ghuilbinn. The trip on the Ossian is one of splendour rather than white water</span><span xml:lang="en-US">;</span><span> that comes on the Ghuilbinn. The low gradient and shallow bed make this run technically easy.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Ossian needs a lot of water. Before planning a descent, consider the amount of rain that has fallen in the last week and especially the last 72 hrs.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is probably the only train-accessed run in the country. To get to the river you need to sweet talk the railway people into carrying boats. This will be easiest if the train has a guards van and you are a small group. Plan to ‘bivvy’ out or make use of the Youth Hostel or bunkhouse at Corrour. From Corrour Station it is a half-hour walk to Loch Ossian. It’s then a 5km paddle along the loch to the river mouth. <span xml:lang="en-US">After paddling down the Ossian, a kilometre of flat water across Loch Ghuilbinn brings you to the start of the Abhainn Ghuilbinn.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Once on to the river you will find the Ossian a float trip. As you leave the trees behind, a small rocky tributary comes in from the right<span xml:lang="en-US">. T</span>o paddle or not to paddle it (hmm...). This signifies the start of the grade 2 stretch; don’t blink or you’ll miss it. This may not be the best white water that Scotland has to offer, but it is an awe-inspiring journey. You are cutting through huge mountains in a narrow valley with some nice surfing if the river is high.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Remember that this river is out in the<span xml:lang="en-US"> </span>‘boonies’ and as such you should be prepared to deal with more than your usual float alongside a road. The whole trip back to the road takes a full 8hrs, without too much inspection. Be aware of the amount of daylight you have.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Moy Burn slips under the A86, 3 miles east of Laggan Dam. It<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s a tiny creek that runs into Loch Laggan and plays a small role in the formation of the mighty Spean. A steep rocky ditch, the Moy provides a short but boisterous run. There are no big drops but several which will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the road bridge it is easy to assess the flow. The run-in to the final falls should look easily floatable as opposed to a bump and scrape. This run improves with water but can get over-high when in flood.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Moy crosses under the A86 on a very fast section of road so care needs to be taken when parking or checking the level. It is best to park where there is access to a section of old road near the ruins at Moy Cottage. Carry up river left to a slightly blocked ramp with an overhanging tree on river right. This is about 300m beyond the deer fence. Take out back at the road bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This trip is a succession of small but challenging drops and ramps. The biggest drop is around 3m high and falls into a deep pool. Take care though, as the water tries to push you up against the slightly undercut and oh so smooth cliff. The drop below the deer fence has a rocky feel to it but should go OK. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">As the burn winds its way through the final tree-lined section things get quite continuous and you soon arrive at the falls you saw from the road bridge. This shallow and jaggy drop was created when the river bed was blasted during road improvements. In the olden days the last fall on the Moy was the hardest and probably the best on the run. A super clean plunge into a deep hole. What lurks now is probably still the hardest but in no way the nicest drop on the run. You may want to stop just above this final cheese grater if you value the bottom of your boat.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Please take care not to damage the deer fence as you cross it on the walk up.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This burn joins Loch Laggan just above the dam, and thus feeds into the River Spean. A strange trip with nice bedrock slabs split round large islands in the river. The upper reaches are hidden away in the forest but generally the river is clear of trees. The run ends with a very obvious boulder rapid flowing into the loch. Right next to the main road, this is probably the most looked at and least paddled rapid in Scotland.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A controlled but slightly scrapey run can be had if the river is up a bit, but it is undoubtedly best when it is stonking. It seems to take a little more rain than you would expect to bring this one up. If there are rocks showing directly under the road bridge, the river will be too shallow. The river could be paddled at most high levels but will be powerful and harder if it is very high.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Laggan Dam, at the put-in for the top section of the Spean, can be found 7 miles east of Roy Bridge on the A86. The Rough Burn flows into Loch Laggan a few hundred metres further east again. Park at the bridge (NN 377 814). This car park can be busy with hill walkers, so it might be necessary to leave cars at the car park by the dam. To get to the put-in<br />cross the stile and carry up the forest road leading upstream. Take the left fork after 1km and wade through the mud at the end of the track to put on beyond the forest edge. Take out at the road bridge or in Loch Laggan if you are feeling brave.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Flat initially, the river soon splits around a large central island. Here the rapids pick up with nice bedrock slabs giving grade 4 boating. The channels join then split again, this time for several hundred metres. Both channels give good paddling with perhaps the right-hand one being best. If you enjoy one channel why not portage back upstream to experience the other? Shortly after the two forks join the gradient eases and the rapids are more bouldery. There is however one large slab still to come, which is quite powerful at a high flow (Gd 5). Watch out for the metal spikes hidden below the water on river right near the top. There is a fence under the road bridge which may be passable on the left, or <span xml:lang="en-US">may be a </span>portage<span xml:lang="en-US">; this is</span> a good time to nip down the river right bank and check the boulder section leading to the loch. It gets gradually harder and<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> depending on the level of the loch<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> it may have a nasty grade 5 boulder drop near the bottom.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">You can start your trip further upstream on the <span class="Pesda-Bold--Emphasis-">Allt a Chaorainn</span>. This is worthwhile if there is a lot of water. It gives another kilometre or so of very tight grade 4/5. If you paddle into Loch Laggan stay well clear of the Laggan Dam as you risk being sucked into the pipe leading to Loch Treig.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Treig flows into the Spean, halfway down the upper section just below the railway bridge (NN 357 799). Its water is held back by Loch Treig which is almost always low, as this is the primary working reservoir of the aluminium smelter, feeding the outflow in Fort William. This short run provides 3 or 4 good ledges and slabs when in spate, and is well worth the walk.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Your best chance of running the Treig is when it has been extremely wet and the dam is overflowing or the small tributaries which join the river are bringing the run into condition. The best gauge is to paddle down the Spean and look at the last rapid on the Treig, just upstream of the confluence. If this 1m ledge has a river-wide curtain of water spilling over it, you are in luck. The dam rarely releases and generally the Treig rises and falls very quickly.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Best <span xml:lang="en-US">paddled</span> in conjunction with the Upper<br />Spean, the Treig is the first river past the railway bridge on the left. If the Treig is high enough, a 10 minute walk-up on river left will bring you to the top of the grade 4 rapids.<br />Alternatively, the Treig can be reached by<br />vehicle by turning off the A86 at Fersit, approx-<br />imately 2½ miles west of the Laggan Dam. Drive past the take-out for the Upper Spean and follow the road over the Allt Coire Laire. Continue until the road becomes a dirt track and you’ll find the obvious road bridge. Egress <span xml:lang="en-US">is best</span> at the end of the Upper Spean run.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Due to the years that this river has been<br />devoid of water, it has started its own regeneration of Caledonian forest. Putting in at the road bridge will find you in a river bed that is equipped with its own ‘growing strainers’. The top section of the river is a true tree infested rocky ditch (Gd 2/3). As the tributaries join to swell the flow, the river shows what it has to offer. The last series of drops are all bedrock and provide quality rapids at grade 4+. Particle Accelerator is a V-shaped slab that shoots you down over a 1m ledge and through two holes. The river now splits and the next rapid is<br />directly downstream. Eddying out here can be a problem in high water. The left-hand channel<br />brings you to Atom Exciter, a fun 3m ledge that gives airborne boofs. Next comes Rear End falls, a ragged double step fall. Finally, Gauge Ledge brings you back into the maelstrom of the Upper Spean.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allt na Lairige flows through the Lairig Leacach pass and into the southern depths of Loch Treig. It is a very remote paddle with a mix of great rapids and some choss. On balance<br />it’s well worth it, but treat it as an expedition, prepare accordingly and take care; you are a <span xml:lang="en-US">long way</span> from help.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The ideal water level would be loads, but not tons! The open upper part of the river needs as much water as possible, but the lower will become more and more scary as the level increases. With the river being so tricky to access it’s probably worth choosing too high rather than too low; but be prepared either to walk some of the lower sections, or for <span xml:lang="en-US">‘</span>death-gnar level 11<span xml:lang="en-US">’!</span> Check that the River Nevis is tanking and that the River Cour (en route to <span xml:lang="en-US">the </span>put-in) is flowing well. Look at the rainfall radar online and check that it is raining over the put-in at the time of your departure.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>In the village of Spean Bridge take the turn</span><span xml:lang="en-US">ing</span><span> at the Commando Bar and head along the single-<br />track road on river left of the Spean. Follow this to Corriechoille</span><span xml:lang="en-US">,</span><span> then on up the rougher track to the car park at NN 254 790. Hike up the<br />forest road beside the Allt Leacach for 5.5km to the bothy. Put in here. From the end of the river<br />you could either retrace your steps, paddle and walk to the train at Corrour, or paddle the length of Loch Treig to where you will have left a car near the village of Fersit. If you choose the latter option it is absolutely essential that the wind is </span><span xml:lang="en-US">behind</span><span> you; it’s a very</span><span xml:lang="en-US">,</span><span> very long way. Another option for access would be to take the train to Corrour and access the river (and the others nearby) from the bottom up.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river will be small and flat for a short time after the bothy but will start to steepen after about 1km. It starts with some mellow slabs and steps before the first proper fall (Gd 4+). From here there<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s a short flat section and then the river finds its true character. Go easy from this point as it could easily get out of control and there may well be dangerous features downstream. There are a number of slightly messy bedrock multi-tier step drops which may improve with higher water (Gd 5). From here the river cleans up as it drops into a series of mini-gorges and some great boating. The final gorge on the river is a big and powerful set of rapids in the middle of nowhere, culminating in a fairly large waterfall. At the time of writing, the author is not aware of a descent.<br />Running these final drops would require a strong team and the right water levels (Gd 5<span xml:lang="en-US">?</span>). After the final set of falls you just have to get back to civilisation; good luck!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allt Coire Laire lies some 20 miles north-east of Fort William. It is a tributary of the Spean, joining the main river about 1km above Inverlair Falls, the take-out for the upper run. This little-known classic is best saved for when one of those Big Water days that we all pine for actually arrives. If you’ve just had a blast on the Upper Spean with all 6 pipes open and a whole lot more, you’ll want to start thinking about getting off the Spean at about where the Allt Coire Laire flows in, well before the scary lead-in to Inverlair Falls. The run starts off fairly flat, braided, and gravelly, in a steep sided, forested glen, but quickly picks up until one twisting bedrock and bouldery rapid links with another. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A small dam at the top of the run means that it needs to have been very wet (torrential rain, or heaps of snow melt plus lots of rain). The run-off is pretty quick, due to the steep sides and shallow soil of <span xml:lang="en-US">the</span> catchment. Where the road crosses the burn (or from the confluence if you’re on the Spean), if it looks pretty ‘scrapey’, with lots of rocks showing through – don’t do it. If, however, the water under the bridge looks as if it can’t wait to join the Spean and go nuts at Inverlair – have a couple of Mars bars and get that boat on your shoulder.

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">Continue beyond the take-out for the Upper Spean</span> for <span xml:lang="en-US">another</span> mile. Once out of the forest, the road goes over the Laire. This bridge, or the confluence with the Spean, is the take-out. To get to the put-in, backtrack to the first house beside the road on the right. Park here and walk for about 2km up the private track to the left. You are in forest all the way, with the odd view down through the trees to the river. When the track goes back down to the river, there is a quarry and a dam – put in here.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Spean is one of the larger rivers on the west that is easily accessible for the kayaker. It<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s never too far from the A86 Spean Bridge to Kingussie road. Glen Spean is a broad open glen that has the mountains of Ben Nevis to the south and Creag Meagaidh (craig meggy) to the north. The views from the upper stretches<br />of the river remind you why you come to the outdoors. The river has four distinct sections<span xml:lang="en-US"> plus the ‘unrunnable’ Monessie Gorge</span>. On <span xml:lang="en-US">six</span> pipes, the upper section offers the biggest volume white<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>water run in the UK. At more reasonable releases, it is still a great fun and continuous run. The Monessie section has an adventurous feel before you even get on the river. Its combination of gorges and long<br />rapids leave the kayaker begging for more. Open water from here gives good boating on the middle section at an easier level. The Spean Gorge is a classic trip, which can be run at low flows. <span xml:lang="en-US">This is a </span>technical run, away from roads for much of its length. The river has been tamed by Laggan Dam. It now only provides entertainment for the big water junkie when Lochaber district is in one of its wetter moods. However, with the Roy as its major tributary, the middle and gorge runs often have good volumes of water. The river has not yet, to our knowledge, been run in its entirety from the dam to Mucomir Power Station in one push, without portages<span xml:lang="en-US">;</span> maybe something for the next generation of kayakers?</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Upper Spean starts at Laggan Dam (<span xml:lang="en-US">NN </span>372 807), <span xml:lang="en-US">9</span> miles east of Spean Bridge on the A86. It follows this road at a discreet distance until it is crossed by the minor road to Fersit. The Upper Spean is probably the largest volume white<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>water run in Scotland. When all <span xml:lang="en-US">six</span> pipes are blowing and there is a large flow coming over the top of the dam, this is the closest thing that you will get to monsoon boating in the Himalaya. Getting in just below the dam is a belittling experience as the amount of water cascading out of the air is phenomenal. The open nature of this run gives excellent boating with continuous white water for the first 2km.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There is no point in coming to the Upper Spean if the Laggan Dam isn’t full. During the summer, a sudden downpour will make no difference to this section of river. During the latter half of the winter and in the spring when the heavens open, the dam will fill and suddenly you will find that the pipes are on. <span xml:lang="en-US">Two</span> pipes gives an interesting run at grade 3+. <span xml:lang="en-US">Four</span> pipes gives an Alpine-like grade 4 run. <span xml:lang="en-US">Six</span> pipes gives monsoon like conditions (full-on grade 4!). No pipes mean no run and no fun. The best gauge is the Laggan Dam. However if you are approaching from Fort William or Inverness then a look over the bridge at Spean Bridge will give an indication as to the amount of water. There is a gauge on the downstream left side of the bridge. Above 4 on the gauge and you may be in luck. Remember that the Roy is a major tributary upstream of here and may account for most or all of the water you see. The SEPA gauge is <span xml:lang="en-US">further downstream </span>on the River Lochy, so again, it may not tell you if the dam is releasing.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Park <span xml:lang="en-US">in the large lay-by beside</span> the A86 <span xml:lang="en-US">next to</span> the dam. Walk down the road for 100m, cross a fence and continue down a steep bracken covered slope. Egress is just above Inverlair Falls on the Fersit road, accessed from the A86 approximately 2½ miles downstream of the dam. There is ample parking on the right after the small bridge that spans<span xml:lang="en-US"> the</span> Inverlair Gorge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The run changes hugely in character depending on the flow. Good for intermediate paddlers on one pipe, it is a total blast on all six! There is a large boulder that produces the infamous pour-over ledge in the middle of the river<br />about 150m downstream of the dam. Once past this the river is fast and continuous for the next 2km, and in the biggest flows moves like grease lightening – swimming here is bad. At this level the trees, usually on the banks, are in the water and escape is going to be hazardous. Generally there are few holes to avoid so relax and enjoy it. Once at the railway bridge the river eases to give you a break. There is one more grade 3+ rapid that can be boat scouted before the gorge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The next time the banks close in signifies the lower gorge, which is best inspected from the left bank. It is at its most technical on two pipes when the entry hole is followed by a large whirlpool that can swallow smaller boats. Don’t let this put the playboaters off; this spot can give lots of fun if you have a nose clip and a bomber roll! Take out at the end of the gorge, river right, under the road bridge, or at moderate flows, paddle the<br />rapid below right of the central rock, then ferry<br />across to take out on river left. Just below<br />here lies Inverlair Falls (Gd 5+). They have been kayaked on the left, but to swim this monster fall is a one-way ticket out of here. There are stories of people being rescued on the lip of the drop and even an epic tale of a paddler being plucked by helicopter from the island that splits the falls. Don’t let this be you. On six pipes, it’s best not to attempt the lower gorge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If you think that a swim in the lower gorge is a possibility then get out and walk the last 150m to the bridge. If you end up swimming in the last gorge then our advice is dump everything and swim for shore as if your life depends on it<span xml:lang="en-US"> </span>... it does!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Monessie Gorge is a hideous cataract blocked by sumps, huge holes and guarded by a large waterfall. <span xml:lang="en-US">It </span>has been scraped down at low flows but would be very serious with the dam releasing. The section described begins immediately below this monster! The Spean has just spent its energy forcing its way through a tortuous gorge and is trying to relax. There are however a few last surprises before Roy Bridge. This is a varied piece of white water, with all the right ingredients. The combination of gorges, flat pools and long open rapids makes for an interesting trip.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To make the most of this run you need at least <span xml:lang="en-US">two</span> pipes releasing from Laggan Dam. However,<br /><span xml:lang="en-US">six</span> pipes may be too much for the uniniti-<br />ated as the grade 5 comes up all of a sudden. As for the Upper Spean, the best gauge is the dam. Looking over the bridge at Spean Bridge may give a false indication about this run, as much of the water here may be coming down the Roy, which joins the Spean below the<br />Monessie section.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Drive upstream from Roy Bridge for 1½ miles to a small turn-off into the woods on the left by a gate. It is possible to drop people off here, but parking is limited to two cars. If you see the river on your right, then you have gone too far. Access is over the road and down the field until you come to the railway line. You can now drop into the small stream bed on your right and pass under the railway via the ‘Tunnel of Fear’. The stupid will trespass on the railway and down climb the muddy bank. Egress is at Roy Bridge where you can get out at the caravan and chalet park, carrying your boats to the village. It is however a long carry to any decent parking, so why not continue on down the middle section to Spean Bridge?</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Emerging from the tunnel under the railway, intrepid paddlers will find themselves at a small pool with a strong jet of water crashing out of the Monessie Gorge and into a cliff. Across this is your warm-up playwave. Out of this pool and you are straight into the first gorge (Gd 3). There are no ‘must make’ lines and a short stretch of easier water is enough for the collection of any debris. Next, the river<br />throws in a long grade 3 rapid and then a shorter stretch of flat water before it rounds a left corner and over Split Decision, a severe grade 5. Get out to inspect on the right at the top of the bank defences. Lines down the left or right are possible at different water levels; it’s your choice. <span xml:lang="en-US">P</span>ut<span xml:lang="en-US">ting </span>in directly below Split Decision is tricky, but worth the effort as you’re straight into the second gorge, which offers fast and furious grade 3+ water. From here down to Roy Bridge, the river is open and relatively flat. A close watch on the bank as you near Roy Bridge is necessary to spot the small sandy beach that marks the egress.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The egress point at Roy Bridge is a private caravan park and not a car park. Please respect the local populace and carry back up to the main road (¾km) and a public car park. It is definitely easiest just to carry on down the Middle Spean to Spean Bridge. This will be a <span xml:lang="en-US">30 minute</span> blast if the river is high.  </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The large 8m entry fall to Monessie Gorge itself is sometimes paddled; you would want one or possibly two pipes releasing. We would highly recommend climbing out river right with the aid of a rope. <span xml:lang="en-US"> Downstream from here, things start to look a lot more unpleasant.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Wide and open, with a mix of bedrock and boulder rapids, the trip from Roy Bridge to Spean Bridge is more straightforward than the other sections of the Spean. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This section can be paddled at almost any level. At lesser flows, it provides entertainment for beginners. Between 1 and 4 on the gauge in Spean Bridge, river left, downstream of the bridge, is a good level. Below this, it can be run, but is a bit of a scrape. In flood, the section becomes fast and continuous, with some good play potential. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">T<span xml:lang="en-US">o reach the put-in, t</span>urn off the A86 in Roy Bridge beside the Roy Bridge Hotel and Grey Corries Lodge. After the road passes beneath the railway bridge it bends to the left. Here there is a stile, and a path to the river. As there is little space on this road it’s better to move vehicles to the public car park in Roy Bridge and walk the short distance to the river. <span xml:lang="en-US">Take out</span> on river left <span xml:lang="en-US">and walk up </span>to the car park in Spean Bridge behind the woollen mill.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>

Here, depending on the water level, you’ll find either a straightforward 1<span xml:lang="en-US">.5</span>m ledge or a more powerful hole. The best line is not obvious from above and there are some places you would not want to be. At medium and low levels, it’s possible to inspect from the slippery rocks on river right on the lip of the drop, but you are now committed to the right-hand side; at higher flows you will need to get out before the start of the long lead-in rapids, river left. The excitement over, the end soon comes, and people may want to continue on through the gorge or take advantage of the shop, restaurant, pub and toilets here in Spean Bridge. Take out river left, at the top of the rapid which runs under the road bridge.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The section starts as a wide and shingle-braided<br />river, with a few small bedrock features. At flows above 3 on the gauge in Spean, a good play wave forms beside a huge bolder on river<br />right. Paddle on past the stanchions of the old railway bridge. Your first glimpse of the ruins of General Wade’s High Bridge marks the approach to Fairy Steps (Gd 3+), a series of small twisting drops. You are now entering the gorge. At medium and low flows, there is one notable rapid with a fun pop-out spot, and a number of smaller chutes before the river narrows at Head Banger (Gd 5). Take care to make an eddy on river left in good time to inspect/protect/portage as necessary</span><span xml:lang="en-US">.</span><span> In recent years the siphon appears to have worsened</span><span xml:lang="en-US">;</span><span> at low flows this is a definite danger. At high flows, it becomes more straightforward, and eventually washes out leaving </span><span xml:lang="en-US">two </span><span>crashing diagonal waves. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Below Head Banger lies the most continuous section. It starts with a narrow gap that feeds you into a small boily area with a leaning wall on the left. There is a small eddy just below this, which holds only one or two boats. The next rapid, The Cave, is no more frightening than the last and gives fewer problems. You have almost escaped the clutches of the gorge now and only have to negotiate the famous Constriction, where at low water the river squeezes<br />through a gap that becomes narrower than your boat. At medium levels, above 1 on the gauge, this chute can be avoided by going over the Gallery Window to the right, although this too becomes feisty in higher water. At higher flows again, water covers the whole feature, the line opens and water races across the pool below and into the cliff beyond. There are only two more rapids left now. The first is obvious (Gd 3+)<span xml:lang="en-US"> –</span> just avoid the large cushion wave on the right. The second has several choices, but watch out for trees. You are now leaving the gorge and there is only the long flat paddle out and fond memories of rapids run to amuse the tired paddler.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a cracking, continuous spate run with drops galore, in the heart of Spean Bridge, though now with added hydro works.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>

More fast, swirly water leads to a 4m fall into a larger pool <span xml:lang="en-US">– </span>a good time to practice your boof in a confined space. More steep rapids follow. Get out when the water flattens to a horizon line at a small weir and the first big drop. This 8m waterfall has a narrow entry and goes down the right with a couple of bounces! The next big drop follows soon after so be prepared to portage river right. The new hydro intake is here. It<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s unknown whether the section after still goes with enough water. Put on where you can and hold on for the next solid section of ramps and drops, all stacked on top of each other but pretty much point-and-shoot – great fun! Watch<span xml:lang="en-US"> out</span> for trees.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Get out before the third big drop which is unfortunately blocked down its entire length by a large tree. Shame, it would probably go. You are soon back at Spean Bridge and the car<span xml:lang="en-US">, </span>but for double the fun, why not paddle out to the raging Spean and a high water run down the <span xml:lang="en-US">g</span>orge.

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a tiny creek, suitable for small groups only. Bank support is recommended as there is hardly room for two on the river at the same time. The current situation with wood blockages is unknown. A couple of hours with a handsaw in the summer was enough to clear things sufficiently when we ran this.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-1"><a id="Anchor-56" />Roy</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Roy is one of the busy rivers on the west coast due to its classic rapids and easy road access. The river splits neatly into three sections, the upper, the gorge and the lower. There is also some good paddling on a couple of tributaries, and the ‘upper upper’ for the adventurous. The river is slow to rise, but will be runnable for a few days after heavy rain. The best time to try the Upper Roy is during spring and autumn downpours. Glen Roy was carved by the glaciers that once covered this part of Scotland. Their retreat left behind ‘parallel roads’ visible on the sides of the glen. Ask any local boater<br />about them and you will no doubt be told about the Roman invaders that started to build a road around the glen from either end. The two teams of slaves missed each other in the mist and the first dual carriageway was made. The real story of how they were formed is on a visitor information board in a small car park on your way to the upper put-in.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a cracking wee run. Very continuous at high flows, it <span xml:lang="en-US">gives </span>a slightly out of control feeling as you flush on downstream. Despite this, nothing is too desperate. At lower flows, a compact series of grade 3 rapids makes for a constantly interesting trip. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Looking over the A86 road bridge, the river should be bank full and flowing powerfully for there to be sufficient water to try the upper section.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The best put-in is at the large bend in the river, ‘the elbow’<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> where the glen opens up and the river is running over shingle banks. There is a large lay-by for parking and turning. Take out below Rooster Tail, where the road comes close to the river, and a small tributary joins from river right, or continue on to below Wish You Were Here, the first rapid in the gorge section, taking out at <span xml:lang="en-US">NN </span>301 876 and walking up over the field to the road.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The open upper section is a nice warm up of easy<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>going grade 3, with gentle steps and a few surf waves when the river is up a bit. The rapids follow each other in quick succession until a longer flat section heralds the approach of Rooster Tail (Gd 4). This rapid is best inspected on the drive up (it can’t quite be seen from the road, but is located by a small building on river right). A final rapid and small tributary on river right mark the take-out. Walk up beside the burn though the sheep pens to the road.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This middle section of the Roy lies in a gorge far below the road. If you have a problem, it will be a long and strenuous climb out on river right in search of the road. The Roy’s unstable slabby geology means that nearly all the main rapids have changed since the river was first paddled. Although there are now 3 potentially<br />dangerous sumps in this section and care should be taken, at the right levels, all the<br />rapids on the river are currently runnable.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The middle gorge can be scraped at most flows. Upstream from the road bridge <span xml:lang="en-US">in</span> Roy Bridge, you will see a band of quartz rock on river left. If the river is up to the level of the quartz the gorge will be at a good medium/high level. In very high water the Roy Gorge is fast and unrelenting; a swim here is punished severely.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving up Glen Roy, the road climbs to an obvious view-point and car park. The gorge can be seen far below. The road then descends to the river and after 2 miles the best put-in is reached. Park at the muddy gateway and walk across the field to find Wish You Were Here. The take-out is on river right after an impressive 1m wide slot. From here a steep track leads up the hill to the road, not for those with a heart complaint. A small stone pillar at the side of the road marks the spot where exhausted paddlers will emerge from their ascent. If the river is high you might avoid this trauma by continuing on down the Lower Roy.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>From Wish You Were Here a section of grade 3+ rapids gets the trip underway. The </span><span xml:lang="en-US">white water</span><span> gradually becomes more continuous with the banks coming in to restrict the paddler’s view as the gorge begins. Watch out for a siphon opening up in a bedrock slot on the right-hand side. An easier rapid above a left-hand bend signals the approach of what was once Head Banger. The rocks here have collapsed leaving a new drop and water pouring through and under a tumble of boulders. A portage at most levels, at medium flows this currently runs at grade 5, although the rapid is likely to continue to change. Inspect and portage on river left. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The action continues with The Brothers Grim (Gd 4+), a ledge split by a large boulder, followed by a short twisting S-bend rapid. There is lots of good grade 3/4 water in the next kilometre. As the walls close in the river drops down a steep ramp into a flushing wave (Gd 4). Below this the river twists and turns giving good eddy hopping. Soon a large boulder constricts the flow, making a ledge drop where a good boof is needed to avoid getting slammed into the left-hand wall (Gd 4+). The boulder creates a dangerous siphon on river right. It is hard to inspect here as rock walls slope down to the water’s edge. For paddlers new to the river, it may be worth inspecting the whole section (river left) from above the steep ramp drop. The river opens for the last kilometre, until a 1m wide slot, through which the whole river squeezes, signals the end of the trip.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This section brings you down to Roy Bridge, just above the confluence with the Spean. The Lower Roy has the confines of an open gorge but the technical difficulty of an open river. The constant gradient gives paddling at grade 2/3 all the way to Roy Bridge. Below here to the egress point there is a rapid that touches on grade 3.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">As with the Roy Gorge, the quartz band of rock upstream of the road bridge gives a good indication of the fun to be had. If the level is below the rock shelf it will be a bit of a scrape. At very high flows, some good surf waves appear.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Lower Roy starts 3 miles up the Glen Roy road; parking is as for the egress for the Roy Gorge. With high usage, the parking at the top of the trail down to the river (NN 297 846) can be congested. Access is down the dirt track. If you can’t park at the dirt track please have a thought for the local farmers when selecting a secondary parking place. The egress point is downstream of the A86 road bridge, below the last good rapid. An obvious eddy on the left allows you to walk out on level ground. Following the path will bring you to a fence with a stile. Walk from here under the railway bridge, past the Grey Corries Lodge and out to the main road. The car park is just over the road bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Lower Roy starts with a small flat section to warm up on before the gradient picks up at a series of S-bends. It is here that the Allt Glas Dhoire enters from the left to swell the volume. As the river continues on its way to Roy Bridge at a constant gradient, a second tributary enters from the right<span xml:lang="en-US">. T</span>his is the same one crossed on the drive to the put-in (the Allt Ionndrainn). In high water, there is a playhole on the right side of the island just above here. In a couple of places care needs to be taken and trees can also create a hazard from time to time. The river has a small kick in its tail below the main road bridge in the way of a fun grade 3 rapid. This is overcome right of centre. The egress point is directly below here where the river flattens out. Alternatively carry on down the Middle Spean to Spean Bridge.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allt Glas Dhoire is a tributary of the Roy, joining the main river on the left just below the take-out for the gorge. This is a super little river, which is usually at the right level when the Roy Gorge is on the high side to run comfortably. Solid grade 3 initially, it becomes pushy grade 4+ further on with little time for rest.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At the confluence with the Roy, the Glas Dhoire should be bank full. If the river is high enough, there will be a good grade 3/4 rapid at this point, with a couple of powerful holes. The upper half of this run would be a real rock bash without enough water, so it’s probably not worth the walk if conditions look marginal.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The neatest way to do this trip is to access the river by paddling down from the start of the Lower Roy. Check the level at the confluence and if all is well, walk up the river left bank. It is a steep haul at first up a long grassy slope before you gain a forest track, which leads up the glen. After 2km the track leads down to and crosses the river. This is the put-in.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river starts as a gentle boulder run. The first noticeable drop is soon upon you and has a nice playhole at the bottom. Take care at the point where the river splits round a central island, as there is a fence across the river just below. The gradient now increases and the river becomes progressively more difficult, climaxing at a gnarly fall with a channel down the left side. This can be surveyed from the eddy on river right, just above the fall. Most of the action is tucked away in a deep tree-lined gorge, and you need to watch out for strainers and other debris. Generally, eddies are small and at higher flows they will be in short supply. Not a good place for a big group! The confluence with the Roy signals the end of a good run. From here it is easiest to carry on down the lower section, which will have the odd surf wave to play on.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The road on the south side of the glen is private.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Draining a large portion of the Grey Corries, the Cour runs through Leanachan Forest to join the Spean just upstream of Spean Bridge. A magical trip of slabs and falls, tucked away in the forest. The highlight is a pushy gorge, which starts with a tasty 4m fall. Sadly, this river is a bit of a hassle to get to and rarely at the right flow... Ahh!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">As with all the streams on the southern side of the Spean, the Cour is severely affected by water abstraction for the aluminium works at Fort William. The section described here lies below the dam, so there needs to be enough water around to meet their requirements and some! Generally heavy rain combined with snow melt gives the best chance of a runnable level. In extreme flows, the upper half of the run feels very continuous.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The small burn next to the Ben Nevis Distillery at the A82/A830 junction east of Fort William gives a good indication of whether the rivers coming from the Grey Corries are over-flowing their dams. If there is a good flow here, the Cour may also be up. A better place to judge the flow on the Cour is the metal bridge at the take-out. A tributary that joins the river below the best of the white water contributes a good deal of the flow here, so the river will have to be full and flowing hard at this point for the run to be on.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To get to the put-in, take the A82 from Spean Bridge towards Fort William. After about 1 mile, turn left onto the minor road leading south to Leanachan Farm. Park here and follow the path that links with the old tramline from the aluminium works. The best put-in is where the tramline crosses the river via a rickety old bridge. It is about a 2km walk (35 minutes). You can take out at the metal bridge just before the river joins the Spean, or continue downstream for another 3km to Spean Bridge. To reach the upper take-out, turn off the A82 in Spean Bridge next to the Commando Bar. Follow the minor road through the village and along the south side of the Spean, until you reach the bridge over the Cour.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The gnarly slab immediately below the bridge at the put-in is perhaps the nastiest feature on the river and you may choose to get in below it. From here, there are a couple of nice ledges before the river ‘goes off’. The main event is a gorge that has some powerful holes at a high flow, but it’s all good clean fun (Gd 4/5). After a couple of kilometres, the drops become more spaced, but you are still carried along nicely. The Allt an Loin joins from river left, and you need to keep a watch out for the lower falls, which are the sting in the tail. Definitely inspect this drop, which is shallow for most of its width. If you really like walking with your boat, the Cour has been paddled from 4km further upstream. Here the river is a roughly even mix of portages, flat water and nice rapids.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This remote and inaccessible burn is tucked away in the most beautiful and delicate valley behind Aonach Mor. You can see its huge upper waterfalls and paddleable sections clearly on a wet day from the war memorial above Spean Bridge. This wee burn epitomises Scottish steep paddling and it’s a great place to walk up to with or without a boat. It has only been completed by a handful of paddlers and will probably take you most of the day to do, so leave plenty of time. (You will be too tired to do anything else after this.)</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A newly built hydro scheme means that there will need to be a fair amount of water around to get this section at a paddleable flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">We’ll leave this up to your own ingenuity, but the forest tracks leading away from Aonach Mor car park may be your best bet. For the car park, turn off the A82 halfway between Spean Bridge and Fort William following signposts for Nevis Range Ski Centre.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">As you walk your boat up the left-hand bank past some of the steepest paddling in Scotland, you’ll know when to put in. The put-in grid ref given is approximate only. You see a set of drops that don’t look ‘worth it’ at the end of a relatively flat section running out from the huge waterfalls further up the glen. From the put-in it’s straight onto a ‘helter-skelter’ slide, past (or into) a rock above a drop with a shallow pool. Try to avoid slamming yourself into the left-hand wall. A narrow slot then leads you into a pool with a truly impressive horizon line. It’s only with the prior knowledge that the next drop is a perfect parabola into a deep pool that one ventures forth. <span xml:lang="en-US">H</span>old your horses and be ready to grab the right bank to make a sharp exit for a walk round the next monster! Put back in directly below and off you go again. Some will opt to walk the next long slide with its scooped-out landing. The cavernous drop above the forestry fencing is awe inspiring, twisting into a narrow pool with, at good flows, a surprisingly sticky hole waiting at the bottom. The next set of smooth slides are an absolute delight, with a speed splat halfway down. A few smaller drops then lead to a flatter section and the end of the run.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Just north of Spean Bridge, the Gloy emerges to flow next to the A82 and into Loch Lochy. The Upper Gloy is a secluded river trip in an open glen. The river has an isolated feel and is continuous in nature.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Upper Gloy rises rapidly during heavy rain and doesn’t hold water for very long. It is paddleable when the river above the narrow bridge at the start of the glen is bank full, i.e. all the rocks upstream are covered. When the river is in full spate the upper section is quite fast and full-on.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Approach by the A82, Spean Bridge to Inverness road. The turn<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>off is signposted Glen Gloy, 2 miles from the Spean Bridge Commando Memorial. The river can be inspected from the narrow bridge on this minor road. Egress here, river left<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> below the bridge. The single-track road continues on to Upper Glenfintaig. Put in here. Do not be tempted to go any further past the farm buildings.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The Upper Gloy is continuously interesting, especially in higher flows. A short gorge leads from the put-in, with the river running at grade 3 for most of its length down to the take-out at the narrow bridge. In one or two places the river narrows producing short action-packed rapids. These can creep up on the unwary. The only rapid of major note is about halfway down</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> wh</span><span>ere a ledge drop can reach grade 5 at higher flows. It is best inspected from river left, and the holes in the centre and the left avoided by a nifty move from left to right. Watch out for low trees, which can become a bit of a nuisance when the river is high enough to run.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Large groups with minibuses/canoe trailers etc. would be advised to be discreet at least. The glen is in continuous use, and has a potentially sensitive access situation. The local farmer has concerns about paddlers scaring livestock into the river when it is in spate. Unfortunately, the run is only feasible in such wet conditions so the best advice is to travel in small groups and take care not to be causing general disruption, or chasing any sheep! Leave the canoe trailer at home – it saves it getting stuck on the bridge!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Lower Gloy is a superb section of water, which although short in length will feel a lot longer. The river runs alongside the A82 in a narrow gorge, before passing under the road bridge and disappearing down an impressive and dangerous gorge to end up in Loch Lochy.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Lower Gloy can be paddled at a slightly lower level than the upper section. Best conditions are to be had when all the rocks below the bridge are covered and the river is bank full. Caution is advised at high spate flows, when the river may reach grade 5.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The run starts at the take-out for the upper section in Glen Gloy. To find the take-out, head back to the A82 and turn right towards Inverness.  Park in the large lay-by on your right, before the A82 crosses the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Once on the water, the gorge starts almost immediately. The rapids are all pretty similar in nature<span xml:lang="en-US"> –</span> narrow in places with some tight lines. The eddies are plentiful and although you should expect to share them with the carcass of a washing machine or other junk hurled down from the main road<span xml:lang="en-US">, d</span>on’t let this put you off, the boating is continually good. There are occasionally trees across the river. Careful scouting should see you clear of all the major obstacles<span xml:lang="en-US">;</span> however things change, not least trees in this section of water<span xml:lang="en-US">, and unless you’ve been here recently, a recce at a lower flow is recommended</span>. Keep an eye open for blockages, especially at the bottom of some of the narrower sections. At higher flows, the drops become less technical, but faster, with stronger hydraulics, and there are fewer eddies. It’s important to get the take-out right. If in doubt, get out above the bridge<span xml:lang="en-US">, river left,</span> and scramble back up to the lay-by on the A82. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Beyond the road bridge, the river continues for a couple of drops before coming to an abrupt end. To paddle further is death on a stick. The river weaves a steep tortuous descent through sumps and ledges to the loch. If you wish to paddle the drops below the bridge there is a take-out on river right on the lip of this monster. However, this is definitely not recommended at high flows. Carry up to the path, <span xml:lang="en-US">and </span>then walk the boats back up to the A82. Please don’t drive down as this is a private road <span xml:lang="en-US">for </span>the holiday homes.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Surely the home of Scottish <span xml:lang="en-US">steep creeking</span>, Glen Coe and Glen Etive offer between them some of the finest burn bashing to be found in this guide. To get the most from this area you will need to like it steep, if not deep, and be up for the odd bit of shouldering your boat.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The waters of the Leven and Coe offer excellent and challenging grade 4/5 boating while the many tributaries of the Etive feature some fine rock bashing action. That said, the falls on the Middle Etive are not as daunting as they look and the upper and lower sections mean that there is something here for everyone. In times of low water, the Middle Etive is usually<br />scrapeable but the area comes into its own when the small burns are running. In very high flows, try the Lower Coe, the Coupall, or perhaps some of the burns surrounding the Kings-<br />house: you’ll have a blast.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">As well as the kayaking, the whole area is an adventure sports hub with summer and winter climbing, skiing, hillwalking, mountain biking and scuba diving! The variety is endless and that is<span xml:lang="en-US"> in</span> addition to the incredible history of the area. Glencoe, a tremendously beautiful and atmospheric place, was the site of the clan massacre of the Macdonalds by the Campbells in 1692, history well worth investigating. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Glencoe village has all the amenities for the travelling kayaker and the Clachaig Inn boasts a good array of beers and whiskies. There are ample campsites, bunkhouses, B&amp;B’s and self-catering chalets in and around Glencoe to suit all pockets, and wild camping is permitted in parts of Glen Etive, although campfires are not.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Looking upstream from the footbridge in the village, the view should be of a shallow boulder field that you can weave through without too many problems. This flow will give a good level for the gorges but render the rest hydraulically challenged, with a generally bony feel. More water gives a harder, more pushy trip.<span class="Annotation-reference char-style-override-6" xml:lang="en-US"></span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The sleepy village of Ballachulish is split in two by the River Laroch. It flows through Gleann an Fhiodh emptying into Loch Leven just north of Glencoe. As it winds its way down the glen, the Laroch moves in and out of dark mysterious gorges. These defiles are split by sections of technical kayaking, demanding nerve and ingenuity to overcome the worst of the obstacles. This river is not exactly designed for kayaking, but it makes for an interesting journey.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Turn off the A82 into Ballachulish and drive to the most southerly end of the village. At this point there is a road bridge with associated footbridge. From here a private road leads south out of the village past the school. There is space at the bridge to park one car; any <span xml:lang="en-US">extra </span>vehicles should be parked elsewhere. From here it’s time to walk: following the road through the farm and onto the footpath to Glen Creran. After 2km you cross a small tributary by some handy stepping stones. Half a kilometre beyond here, look out for the spot where the river drops from an open and shallow channel into a dark, tree<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>lined gorge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The start of the top gorge is guarded by Entry Falls (Gd 5). This fall is a benchmark for the river. From here a series of small drops ends at a cool boof ledge, deep in the gorge. The river is now a mixture of tight squeezes and narrow chutes, the most notable of these being ‘What You See Is What You Get’ (Gd 4+). At times the river is almost laughably narrow, quite a giggle as long as you don’t get jammed somewhere you shouldn’t. The river now has you in its spell; and the drops are flashing past as you become adept at reading the water from your boat. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Just as you are settling in, the river picks up and throws in a multi-drop grade 5. Shortly after this is the most serious drop of the run, Sick &amp; Twisted (Gd 5+), a five stage slot/shelf drop. If you decided to give this one a miss, it<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s possible to seal launch back in from the left bank and run the super cool ledges just downstream. From here the river remains narrow for a while, as it passes through several slate rock bands. A small tributary, the Allt Socaich, enters from river right. Just below this there<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s a clean and picturesque double drop (Gd 4). The river is now more open and boulder strewn as it picks up size on its way down to Loch Leven. There are however still plenty of drops and ledges to keep you entertained. Take out just below the footbridge on river right. <span xml:lang="en-US">With </span>bigger flows the lower section, from the Allt Socaich, would be a good run of grade 4+.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There are plenty of overhanging trees on this run and as usual these tend to end up in the water. This is an intense little run with more rapids than you could shake a stick at. Expect some equipment damage.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allt Lairig Eilde drops into the Coe at the Falls of Glen Coe, a popular tourist stop beside the A82. For the run to be on, water should be starting to run over the slab on river left of the upper fall. It’s an exciting wee tributary, with some crazy falls, slabs and narrow chasms to negotiate. Some unlikely looking drops do go, although elbow pads and old blades are a good idea. There is a clean looking 10m drop near the end, but watch out as the pool is shallow. The run ends with the Falls of Glencoe. Make sure you take a camera!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Access is from the lay-by on the corner of the A82 where the Allt Lairig Eilde tumbles into the river over the obvious three tiered Falls of Glen Coe.

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Flowing beside the A82, the Upper Coe is hemmed in by a very restricted gorge, which is at times only as wide as a kayak. This gives a threatening and bizarre feel with most of the rapids having only one route of dubious quality. While the upper part is a true portage fest, the river eventually widens and produces some interesting deeper gorges, with some enjoyable grade 4 water. Comments from those who have run the river include; ‘This run is a true rocky ditch and is only recommended for those who have a ticking fetish’ and ‘I have run the river once and have no desire to run it again’. On the other hand some people do like this run!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This lower section of the River Coe is situated just outside the Clachaig Inn, a handy place to toast success or ponder disaster! The Lower Coe is a mixture of delights. It starts with an open section that is clearly visible from the road. A good spot to massage your ego, as tourists stop to stare at the crazy people in the rain. From there it drops into a vertically sided gorge with no escape. Then as suddenly as the gorge started, it is finished and you are catapulted between overhanging trees and out into a wide flood plain. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">For experts to get the best out of the Lower Coe, you must have walked away from all the other rivers in the area, as they are far too full to be run. At lower flows, the river is less powerful and still entertaining. The upper part of this stretch can be viewed from the A82. If the river looks a little bony, the gorge can be run by itself and gives a pleasant run at about grade 4. If there are few rocks showing and the river is a series of waves, the run will be a ful<span xml:lang="en-US">l-</span>on grade 4+ experience.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Put in from the lay-by off the A82 where the river flows out of Loch Achtriochtan. Egress can be taken at several places. The most popular is where the river approaches the A82 opposite the Glen Coe Visitor Centre entrance (NN 113 574). There is a small gate beside the road and a large car park at the visitor centre. Alternatively, you can take out before this, immediately after the last fall and walk back up to the road to a large lay-by on the A82, which is also the access point for the next river, the Allt na Muidhe (NN 119 564). Some choose to paddle further to the road bridge in Glencoe Village, or into Loch Leven<span xml:lang="en-US">.</span>  </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Getting boats and gear off the roof of a vehicle can be the hardest part of this trip; when there is big water in Glencoe it is usually accompanied by gale force winds. Once you’ve warmed up it’s away and under the road bridge – make sure you pick the correct arch! The crashing wave that waits soon lets you know what’s in store. From here to the first rapid it’s grade 3 boating with a couple of ‘class’ surf waves. The river has considerable power given its<br />relatively small size. Get out after the surf waves as Back Door Man (Gd 5-) awaits you around the corner. There are a couple of lines that can be run, both with varying degrees of success. This is followed by Entry Falls, which at grade 4+ has a Himalayan feel. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The gorge is next: eddying out above it gives you a chance to collect your thoughts and<br />inspect from the bridge. You can walk with some effort down the river left bank to check that it is clear of trees. This <span xml:lang="en-US">500</span>m section is basically solo boating when the river is high and rescue from the bank is out of the question due to the speed of the water and the vertical sides. Enter here and receive the Coe experience. The river is pushy grade 4+. Its huge waves and boils fire you along its length like a bullet from a gun. At high flows, there is only one eddy to make about half-way through the gorge. The gorge ends soon after the eddy and all feelings of pleasure and relief are overtaken by the worry that the river is now overhung by trees and moving like an express train. There is the odd tree to negotiate and two more rapids. The first, marked by a horizon line and rocks on the left is grade 4. It<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s easy to miss from above, but generally runs on the right. The last major rapid<span xml:lang="en-US"> (Gd 4+)</span> comes up very fast. There<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s a line on the left and another centre-right if you can find it. The rapid has a strange fold and a powerful stopper that sucks in boats and gives them a sound thrashing. Scout if you can get out in the trees or take the consequences!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From here the river opens out into a wide braided section with several channels. Below the usual take-out there is one final rapid just beyond the road bridge. <span xml:lang="en-US">A definite portage at most flows, </span>Glencoe Village Falls (Gd 5+) is ugly, narrow and has a sump in it. Care is needed here and it is not a recommended place for a swim. The river now spews out into Loch Leven. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Although none of the rapids are rated individually above grade 5-, when in flood, all normal <span xml:lang="en-US">white water</span> rules are out of the window. It is not a good idea to get on this river without a ‘bomber roll’, as the force and speed of the water will be your downfall. You can run the Coe at a lower level, but at high flows it is an awesome experience.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Classy grade 4/5 action intermingled with some scary rock features can be found on the Allt na Muidhe, a tributary which joins the Lower Coe just after the end of the gorge. Take good care where a tributary joins from river right in the latter half of the run. A nasty boulder sump is well hidden at the foot of a rapid just above here with more unrunnable water just below! It is best to portage on river left, regaining the river just downstream of the confluence by an awkward seal launch into the narrow potholed channel.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Tumbling from the Aonach Eagach ridge, this burn crosses the B863 midway between Glencoe village and Kinlochleven. This is a short and steep section of river, ideal for getting some drops under your belt. Narrow and twisting with plenty of rockslides and drops, the Allt Gleann a’ Chaolais has it all, with easy access and rescue. Bring your own camera crew!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Spate conditions are needed to bring the best out of this gnarly little section, but you wouldn’t want too much water. If you can see rock through the lower drop, there is only just enough water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Parking consists of two very small lay-bys on the downstream side of the bridge. Please do not move the white stones, and be aware that you are on a tight bend. As you walk up beside<br />the river, you can choose your own put-in. Most paddlers get out just above the bridge. In very high water, it is possible to continue down to Loch Leven with one portage.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The action starts about <span xml:lang="en-US">a kilometre</span> above the road with a largish fall into a shallowish pool! From here the drops come thick and fast. Broaches, rocksplats and nose scrapes are the dangers and from time to time trees block the route. One extremely narrow slot is normally portaged and you would be wise to find this in advance. The last two main drops on this section both have hard entries at high water. Overall the run is very easy to inspect, almost from the car!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Nathrach runs off the Mamores, next to the West Highland Way, and cuts a gorge down to the loch, close to Kinlochleven. This river has everything: tight, technical paddling, big falls and much, much more. Situated in a deep gorge with high wooded sides, tree jams are common and rescues extremely difficult.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If the fall by the road looks picturesque, and has a good steady flow then the section will be in condition. The fall itself is too shallow to run. If the river is in thunderous spate con-<br />dition, look elsewhere.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The take-out is at the B863 road bridge, just over a mile from Kinlochleven, on the north side of the loch. To reach the put-in, drive back towards Kinlochleven, and turn left up the minor road/track to the now-closed Mamore Lodge Hotel (NN 186 629). Walk along the Old Military Road west towards Fort William, then drop down to the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The start point (NN 163 629) gives a narrow twisting journey down to the obvious confluence. This section is pretty extreme with some definite portages which will probably need some rope work! At the junction of the two tributaries, the flow increases but the run does become a little more reasonable. That said</span><span xml:lang="en-US">,</span><span> the run from here is incredibly exciting, with every possible problem and no let-up. After a log jam there is a huge double fall of over 20 metres! The second drop (10m) has been run, but the bigger one</span><span xml:lang="en-US">,</span><span> </span><span xml:lang="en-US">we believe, </span><span>still awaits a challenger. This is really a day for extreme adventure paddlers wanting a challenge. If you portage round you will find the action continues below until yet more unrunnable drops above the bridge.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A full gorge walk inspection is recommended before attempting this run as you can drop into non-reversible pools. Failing this<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> you will need bank support with abseil equipment and good knowledge.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The River Leven is tucked away at the head of Loch Leven and neatly splits the town of Kinlochleven in two. The Blackwater reservoir was built at the beginning of the 20th century to harness the power of the Leven. The water that should be in the Leven was instead used to generate electricity for the production of aluminium. The smelter is now closed but the water has not been freed! It is still harnessed and electricity fed to the smelter in Fort William. The Leven runs through a series of water worn gorges giving fine bedrock rapids. These are all committing and several give good sport at grade 5+. The central section of the river is the hardest and most temperamental in terms of water levels.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There needs to be a reasonable amount of water<br />around to counteract the influence of the dam, unless water is being released. Looking upstream from the footbridge across the river at the west end of the village, the river should cover approximately 50% of the river bed. A small playhole just upstream of the <span xml:lang="en-US">foot</span>bridge serves as a good gauge. If the hole looks playable the trip is on! <span xml:lang="en-US">If there’s m</span>uch more water the trip is still possible but the biggest falls will be verging on ridiculous! It may be wisest to walk up and check out the last big fall, MacKays<br />Falls, as this is one of the harder drops.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the road bridge in the village, find the minor road that leads up river right. Park where it is no longer navigable and a short walk in the same direction, on a dirt path<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> will lead you to the gauge bridge. To walk to the put-in find the footpath which leads up river right. It is signposted to the dam. After the wooden bridge across the Allt na-h-Eilde tributary, it is only a matter of following the path for a short distance until you draw level with an obvious spill gully below a concrete building, high on the opposite bank. A short bush<span xml:lang="en-US">whack</span> brings you back to the River Leven and the top of the first rapid.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The warm<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>up rapid, Three Falls to Agrippa (Gd 5), is a peach for a starter. The two bedrock ramps, each 3m in height with pools to land in, lead to a vertical entry of 2m into a funky twisting narrow slot with rocky exit fall. Upon leaving the collection pool a small gorge of grade 3+, Cockstone Gorge, brings you to the start of the exciting stuff. Notable rapids include Boof It, an obvious must-boof ledge, and The Gutter, an easy grade 3. These are followed by The Drain Pipe, a low angle slab with a powerful hole at its base, and The Plug Hole (Gd 5+), a nasty twisting drop that looks ugly in anything but low flows. It is possible to avoid a portage by taking the chicken chute which joins the tributary by using one of the small clefts branching from the right side of the river on the lip of The Plug Hole. From here a short grade 4 section leads you back to the main<br />river just on the lip of one of the most impressive cataracts in Scotland.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At grade 5+, End of the World is easily the most full<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>on rapid on the river. This eye-opening<br />cataract has four large falls, which once<br />committed to must be finished. The first two falls are both 4<span xml:lang="en-US">.5</span>m, and can be protected with difficulty. The last twin fall, and biggest at a combined height of 11m, lands in what can be a nasty corner hole. By down climbing the left side of the gorge it is possible to set up protection for this last show of bravado. The cataract finally spills out over a 2m ledge then into an awkward 90 degree left corner, I Feel Fine. At grade 5, this is a class way out of the gorge. It is possible by some delicate climbing to run this rapid if you have walked the End of the World.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A short grade 3 boulder section now brings you to another narrowing where some interesting grade 4 lurks. Just past this is MacKays Falls.<br />An obvious horizon line hides a 6m free fall, which sounds cool until you check out the cave<br />behind the left side of the fall. A seemingly<br />unavoidable flat landing will convince the prudent to walk this one. Now the river calms down until the gauge bridge is reached.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Elbow pads and a full-face helmet are the ticket on this baby. Be sure to book the hot tub before the run, as this one is hard on the back. This river is one of the test<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>piece rivers of the area and with water in it, will frighten the pants <span xml:lang="en-US">off</span> even the best of boaters. Come mentally prepared! There is a playhole, which runs year round, just below the main road bridge in Kinlochleven. Small and friendly it’s ideal for those new to playboating. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-1"><a id="Anchor-72" />Glen Etive</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Glen Etive is situated off the A82 near the Kingshouse Hotel. A <span xml:lang="en-US">once </span>lonely glen just south of Glen Coe, this is a great place to spend time. The glen is best visited during the spring or autumn, as during the summer the midges here make the ones on Skye appear friendly! The outstanding beauty of Glen Etive has led to an increase in its popularity, especially with the kayaking fraternity. The clean bedrock falls and tight delightful gorges with twists, chutes and freefall give rise to a kayaker’s paradisiacal playground on earth. The river has something to offer from beginner to extreme play-boating<br />river god. To give close bank support for this playground the road runs alongside the river for most of its course through the glen. The river offers several sections, all of great character. The <span xml:lang="en-US">white water</span> in the middle section in particular can rival anything else on the face of the planet. The upper and lower runs still offer the solitude but cannot match the intens-<br />ity of the middle section. As a consequence, the middle run is bombarded with large groups of kayakers especially on weekends and during holiday times. <span xml:lang="en-US">On </span>such <span xml:lang="en-US">occasions</span> the feeling of isolation is no longer here.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river has become extremely popular in<br />recent years after an appearance in the James Bond film ‘Skyfall’. As a result, the glen now sees more traffic and sadly more damage from careless people, especially in summer months. Please help us keep the paddling reputation a high one and behave with respect and courtesy. You might even want to consider <span xml:lang="en-US">taking home </span>any litter that you come across. Let’s keep this place beautiful and keep enjoying it for years and years to come!</p>

The beauty of Buachaille Etive Mor (booachal etive more), often known simply as The Buachaille, is best admired from the small bridge behind the hotel. With its gentle boulder bed, this stretch of river is ideally suited to the intermediate kayaker; there is only one fall that will have to be portaged.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Upper Etive is a scrape unless the river is high. If, as you pass over the river on the A82, there are no boulders showing, then the upper section will be a grade 2 float with one portage or grade 5+ fall.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Access is from the Kingshouse Hotel. Sensible parking here is important as the narrow road is in constant use with patrons of the hotel and walkers. You may need to drop off your gear and park away from the river. Egress is at the start of the Middle Etive. Parking can be congested here so the use of the large lay-bys a kilometre upstream may be advised. Cars parked here can easily be seen from the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Etive is very benign in its upper stretch and meanders over the bouldery river bed. The only fly in the ointment for the beginner is Buachaille Etive Falls (NN 245 543). This grade 5+ fall tumbles over slabs for about 9m then takes a 3m plunge into a rock infested pool. Once around this there is more <span xml:lang="en-US">pleasant </span>grade 2 water until the vehicles are seen in the lay-by or you pass under an old sheep trolley 200m above the Triple Falls<span xml:lang="en-US">, which mark the start of the middle section</span>. Taking out well above this is recommended in high water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If attempting this section in high water<span xml:lang="en-US"> ensure you stop well above both the grade 5+ fall and Triple Falls.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A classic series of bedrock falls, this is one of the most famous pieces of white water in Scotland. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Water levels rise and fall quickly on the Etive. In autumn<span xml:lang="en-US"> and </span>spring the river will come up in a couple of hours<span xml:lang="en-US">, whereas i</span>n a dry summer it may take a day of persistent rain. If, as you cross the Etive on the A82, there are no rocks showing in the river, then the middle section is going to be out of order. A better gauge as you drive down the glen is at the first rapid, Triple Falls. If a boulder splits the second fall, then the river is low. If this rock is gone, then we are talkin’. If there is a large ugly pour-over ledge here, you may want to look elsewhere.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Put in directly above Triple Falls. There is limited vehicle space here and kayakers usually park in one of the passing places on the single track Glen Etive road. Egress is after the bridge, near the Allt a’ Chaoruinn. Parking is also limited here so please pull well off the road.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>Triple Falls is a good test of your nerve and skills. With a combined height of 3m for the first two drops, this is classic grade 4 territory.<br />Just around the corner is the final fall in<br />this combination. A generous pool allows the collection of any flotsam. You don’t have to go far downstream to come across the next horizon line. Letterbox is slightly stiffer at grade 4+. A line close to the left bank, and going left, with a hefty boof will get you past. Beware of the undercut boulder on the right. Immediately downstream is Ski Jump (Gd 3). This is probably the easiest fall on the river and lands in a pleasant pool. A short and beautiful gorge leads you out and down through some easier water to the first real test of your journey. Crack of Doom (Gd 4</span><span xml:lang="en-US">+</span><span>) is a narrow slot that is guarded by a boulder run-in. Many top boaters have had deep experiences here. Two tight corners and a </span><span xml:lang="en-US">3m</span><span> drop into a deep pool</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> follow</span><span>. If you are starting to get into the river then you will be pleased to know that you are soon to fall upon the Crack of Dawn (Gd 4). This is usually run on the sneak route left over a ledge into a deep flat gorge – the mainline is shallow and unappealing. Easy water with a couple of surf waves brings you to Rock Slide (Gd 4-). This granite slab gives a thrilling run on either side. The left side gives the play-<br />boater some fun in a shallow, but retentive, hole halfway down.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The short flat stretch that follows ends at an ominous horizon line. This is Eas an Fhir Mhóir, the Big Man’s Falls, also known as Right Angle Falls (Gd 4+). The height of this fall depends on the amount of beer consumed while telling the tale, but is generally accepted to be in the region of 6m. For many this will be their first taste of free-fall. Enjoy it, for it doesn’t last long. The following gorge is a nice rest from the strenuous activity upstream and leads out to the boulder run down to the last classic grade 4 fall. From here, it<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s a short run through the narrow gorge to the usual take-out just below the private road bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To continue from here to the Dalness Falls is a pleasant grade 2 run. There’s only one rapid<br />of note, which runs at grade 4. A distinct plume of spray and a large beach on the right marks where you can get out and inspect the approach to this rapid.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Dalness section starts where the road loops briefly away from the river, some 2 miles beyond the take-out for the usual run.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>Double Falls open the run. At grade 4, this 2</span><span xml:lang="en-US">.5</span><span>m fall has two options. Next comes an ugly narrow slot, where a well-trained bank team is a must. Now you are at the start of the final<br />section. A clean boof left off the next fall will avoid contact with the opposite wall and set you up for the narrow slot. A small rapid brings you into a cosy eddy above the 7</span><span xml:lang="en-US">.5</span><span>m Dalness Falls. A right line is a must as the left side lands on a rock ledge, which is visible in very low flows. Once in the pool your troubles are not over as the right wall is undercut. It has been known for a person and boat to disappear under the wall and, with much effort on behalf of the bank support team, reappear downstream. Carry back up, or float down to the start of the next section.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A high level leads to a more exciting trip with the main rapid becoming a grade harder. This is not one to do at low flows. If the middle section is too high this could be a good option.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The best access is about ½<span xml:lang="en-US"> </span>mile below Dalness Falls, at a point where the road comes close to the river on a bend. Egress is to the road on the right, just before the river enters the loch.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the recommended access point, there is about 2km of easier water until you reach Lake Falls (Gd 4), which is visible from the road just upstream of an obvious detached lake. This fall is somewhat technical and leads into a small gorge. At high flows this rapid becomes<br />harder and the gorge disappears. From here to the <span xml:lang="en-US">take-out</span>, there are some interesting<br />sections, with higher water being best.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This short run needs plenty of rain, and has just a ‘Coupall’ of good rapids! It flows below Buachaille Etive Mor and can be seen from the A82 when travelling north towards Glen Coe. There is a large lay-by in sight of the drops. It’s easy to park here, wander across, run the two grade 4s, and wander back. There is a further gnarly grade 5 rapid, after a bit of a flat section near the confluence with the Etive. If you really<br />want to run it, tackle it down the guts or via a chicken chute on river left. The run combines well with some other Etive trib bashing and a run on the Coe when it’s pouring with rain.</p>

After the road bridge there is a horizon line; it’s a bit bumpy but goes fine centre-right. The main rapid is best inspected by breaking out (also known as grabbing the bank and hoping the heather doesn’t give way) before a large slab of rock on a sharp left bend. Wander down the right-hand bank for a gander at the long grade 4 that awaits. The rock slab is a nice seal launch for getting back in. Some small drops lead to a boof ledge straight into a long slide that can have an interesting hole part</span><span xml:lang="en-US">-</span><span>way down. At the bottom of this is another drop that boofs nicely, but has a bit of a tow back if you get it wrong.

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allt a’ Chaoruinn (owlt a’ choorun) is one of the better known tributaries of the Etive. This charming little creek joins the main<br />river at the take-out for the Middle Etive. It<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s a dream river for the fanatic of the extreme. Its bedrock chutes and slides are something out of your wildest fantasy. At over 80m/km this is a taste of what all steep creeks should be like.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This burn needs only one night of good rain to make it runnable. Too much and it quickly becomes a raging torrent. It may be a good option in a summer downpour, or with a spring snow melt. At high flows, it’s grade 5 territory! If the run-out to the Etive looks boulder strewn but OK, it’s a sure indicator that the drops will be bony but runnable. If the run-out has few rocks visible, you’re i<a id="x.39725" />n for a cool run. When there are no rocks visible on the run-out, <span xml:lang="en-US">the run will be epic</span>. Due to the very small catchment area, this river and its sisters rise and fall faster than a third world dictatorship.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Park at the take-out for the Middle Etive. Walk across the bridge and along the track. This joins the burn at the last rapid. <span xml:lang="en-US">Cross the stile and w</span>alk upstream scouting as you go. You are at the top when you reach the fourth drop. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The first 6m slide, Speed, </span><span xml:lang="en-US">run</span><span>s in a gutter with only one way down, unless the river is high. It is fast and exciting, but not technically difficult. The wall at the bottom provides a good splat spot. Next is Ecstasy, the longest rapid on the river. Several drops and slides provide the entertainment with some sticky holes when the burn is high. Don’t forget the Tea-Cup Eddy, half-way down. The rapid ends in a large pool, where you can collect your thoughts before the next drop. Looking at Pinball it’s easy to see how this rapid got its name. Beware of the flipper rock that diverts the water to the right as this has claimed several cag sleeves and elbows. If the river is high, a second line opens up down the left, which is hard to get, but rewarding. The last drop is the Chasm</span><span xml:lang="en-US">;</span><span> again there is only one</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> </span><span>way in. This drop has been run without paddles, as they are (or can be) a nuisance. The ledge out of here is best boofed on the extreme left. From here the run down to the Etive is an easy respite from the ravages of the Allt a’ Chaoruinn.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At the time of writing, 2017, there <span xml:lang="en-US">wa</span>s the threat of a hydro scheme here. Those that have seen the tiny flows on this burn most of the year round will scratch their heads and wonder how this could ever provide worthwhile or efficient power. You may also wonder who is going to use any power, as the population of Glen Etive is a just handful of people, a few sheep and several million midges.

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A nice little side creek for when the Middle Etive is running high, this burn needs to be flowing well under the road bridge. Walk up, river left, a couple of hundred metres to the main drop. If the cauldron looks inescapable, go elsewhere. We put in at a nice section of bedrock S-bends. There is a gorgey bit higher up that might be worth a look. Grade 4 water then leads to the <span xml:lang="en-US">c</span>auldron with a narrow entrance and a 3<span xml:lang="en-US">–</span>4m fall, followed by a paddle out under rhododendrons to the car.

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The second of the two renowned ‘Etive Tribs’, this is a short, steep toboggan ride in the lush scenery of lower Glen Etive.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This burn is reached by walking down a track from the road (NN 130 464; 56.5726, -5.04457) crossing the Etive and climbing up to the white water. You have to repeat this<br />palaver to get back after your run. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">More paddleable than some of the other tribs, the Allt Mheuran is worth a visit. Some ‘wicked’ falls lie tucked away <span xml:lang="en-US">in the confines </span>of this burn. They can be paddled at a variety of water levels, from medium low (scrapey) to high (scary). Boof the top drop: at high levels the pool at the bottom becomes one massive boil/cauldron. The next small narrow drop has a very sticky tow-back. The following section is now unfortunately blocked by a boulder<span xml:lang="en-US">, requiring more water to get past than previously</span>. Below this, the burn leads into the main feature, a 10m water-slide into a 5m fall. The bottom drop sends you far out into the pool giving just enough time to do some tricks for the camera. The lower half of the river is a boulder scrape regardless of flow, but it’s worth making the effort for the rest. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a large area running from just north of Glasgow in the south to the Rannoch Moor in the north. The A82 runs the length of the section and allows for easy access to many of the runs. Generally, the rivers here require some rain to bring them into condition. If none has fallen recently you may find your options limited, the Awe and Orchy being your best bet. As the levels rise the Lochy and Lower Falloch soon come into condition and when the heavens really open you can have your pick of any number of classics, the Kinglass, Cononish and Upper Falloch to name but a few. After the storm, as the rivers drop once more, the Orchy shows itself as the ‘jewel in the crown’ as it holds its water well. It offers both fine playboating and some scary rapids, in a setting which is accessible yet peaceful, and normally windswept too!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving south along the A828, the Salachan Burn is crossed 2 miles beyond the village of Duror. Beyond the bridge, a forestry road leads upstream to the put-in. Vehicular access is by permission only; contact the Lochaber Forest District office on 0300 067 6870. Otherwise it’s a 2.5km walk-up to find a suitable start point in the region of the house at Bealach.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A fun trip with lots of interest, there are two good-sized falls interspersed with some nice bedrock rapids. At high flows, it gets quite pushy and you need to go very carefully to keep the trip under control. In a more moderate spate, it’s still entertaining with fun to be had finding your way from eddy to eddy.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Esragan flows into the north side of Loch Etive at its western end. This is a serious run, with a very isolated upper gorge and a steep, continuous lower boulder section. A hydro scheme has been installed in the lower section recently – it remains to be seen what impact this has had on the paddling.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This run needs very heavy rain to bring it into condition. As a rough guide, it will be running if the Orchy is on 3+ at Bridge of Orchy and it’s still raining. Looking upstream from the bridge at the take-out, the river should look runnable but a little scrapey.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The take-out for this run is at the B845 road bridge, on the shores of Loch Etive. From here to reach the put-in, drive up the glen away from Loch Etive, until you reach a sharp left-hand bend, where the road leaves the river (NM 985 368; 56.4800, -5.2737). To reach the upper gorge, walk upstream for about an hour, until the confluence of three streams. To run the lower boulder section, contour around the hill from where you have left the car, until you reach the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The run starts with a deep remote upper gorge. The rapids are pool-drop in nature and generally grade 4/4+. The grade would, however, go up at very high flows and some of the rapids would be very difficult to portage. Watch out for trees jammed in this upper stretch. The lower boulder section is very continuous and much steeper, with an average gradient of 6%. There is one stretch in particular which is steeper than the rest of the run, and almost certainly a portage, depending on the flow.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This well-known tidal playspot lies under Connel Bridge, some 5 miles north of Oban on the A85. It forms on the ebb tide as water draining from Loch Etive cascades over a reef in the narrow mouth of the loch, kicking up some stunning surf waves, and at times sizeable whirlpools! When there has been no rain it can be the saviour of a weekend if the tides are playing ball, though can be well worth a trip in its own right.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A third-party website has good information on tides h<a href="http://www.fallsoflora.info/">ttp://www.fallsoflora.info/</a>. Roughly, you’re looking for the difference between high and low tide to be over 3 metres, the low tide to be less than 0.7 metres, and to get there about 3½ hours after high tide to make the most out of the session.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Park at the northern end of the Connel Bridge. If driving north over the bridge, take the first right and park in the obvious waste ground/parking area. Walk down the hill from the car park to the inland side of the bridge and put on in the eddy above the falls.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">On the biggest spring tides of the year, this site throws up some very large crashing waves, intimidating whirlpools and huge boils. Paddlers with a bombproof roll will have a ball, but note well that this is a more serious place than your average playspot as swimmers are carried out into the middle of the widening channel, and if you get unlucky with a whirly, you can<br />expect some significant downtime. There are three waves that consistently form. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Starting from the top, the Forever Wave is a wide rolling hump of green water that forms as the water slips over the submerg<a id="x.48190" />ed reef. It is a chilled surf at any time, but with clear <br />water, a sunny day and the kelp waving at you from the sea bed a few metres below, it’s easy to understand how it got its name. There’s no eddy service for this one, so if you want a second run, you’ll have to shoulder your boat and carry up for round two. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Main Wave is close to the northernmost bridge stanchion and is well served by an eddy – the current here can get quite strong during spring tides. At big tides, it generally takes the form of a crunchy hole with a large green shoulder on surfer’s right. The munchiness of this hole decreases at lower tide differentials. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">On the far side of the Main Wave and 50 metres<br />downstream is the Ultimate Wave, a surging unpredictable mass that can give awesome rides to those taking the effort to get there (but can equally flush you straight off and mash you in the whirlies). Either drop down to it from the Forever Wave, or cross above the Main Wave, fight your way into the mid-<br />channel eddy and drop in from there. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The wave seems to go through cycles of working well and being ‘broken’. One theory is that it is possibly due to the cycles of kelp growth, but whatever it is, look online for the latest beta to save disappointment.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At the time of going to press (2018) an<br />experimental tidal power platform has been installed 500m west of the bridge. This is only temporary and apparently safe to craft as the turbines are well below the surface; nonetheless it is best avoided. A welcome development that hopefully will be a success.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The River Noe is tucked away at the south end of Loch Etive. It’s a remote run with access along a private estate track. The land owner is friendly but will never disclose the combination for the padlock that would prevent a whole world of pain. The reward for your<br />efforts is a festival of drops, slides and rapids. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Lots of rain is needed. If you see no rock bed and fast flowing water running into the loch under the bridge then it goes. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There are other adventurous way to get to the river but this is what we did. Turn off the A85 towards the Inverawe Smokery. Before the <span xml:lang="en-US">s</span>mokery, take the forestry track off to the right, passing a large car parking area. Continue<br />up the track, <span xml:lang="en-US">ignoring</span> the first right fork <span xml:lang="en-US">and </span>the left to the private house, <span xml:lang="en-US">but continue </span>up the hill. Be discrete and only take one car if you can, preferably with off-road capacity. Drive as far as you can until you come <span xml:lang="en-US">to </span>a lay-by in front of a locked gate. Saddle up and start walking. It’s a 30 min walk to the gauge bridge. When you are close to the loch side you may choose to paddle the last 500m to rest your shoulders. You will see the river as you cross the bridge<span xml:lang="en-US">.</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">C</span>ontinue <span xml:lang="en-US">on </span>the farm track over the river through the farm yard and head up the glen. <span xml:lang="en-US">After </span>1hr of walking and inspecting <span xml:lang="en-US">you’</span>ll <span xml:lang="en-US">arrive at</span> the river access.

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river starts with a grade 3 mini box-gorge. This is followed by a grade 3+ slide into a fall (Gd 4). The upper section ends with a big<br />waterfall landing on rock (portage). </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The lower section is in a closed-in wooded glen with some brilliant grade 4 water<span xml:lang="en-US">;</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">w</span>atch out for trees.

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>

This river has some awesome slabby features (but plenty of flat water too) and has been accessed by walking west from the head of Loch Tulla, by Bridge of Orchy. Be warned, it’s a long, long way to carry/paddle to get there. For most, this trip will be more fun on a mountain bike, starting at Tyndrum and returning by train from Taynuilt.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The <span xml:lang="en-US">River </span>Awe flows between Loch Awe and Loch Etive. The section that runs alongside the A85 Lochearnhead to Oban road near the village of Taynuilt makes a classic beginners’ trip. The barrage at the Pass of Brander keeps the level fairly constant, making this a good river when all else is low. In these conditions, it is a scrape as far as the A85 road bridge. The river is at the top end of its grade when two or more sluices are open. At high levels the river races down the glen<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> and the lack of eddies can<br />result in prolonged swims. There are arranged releases and information on these can be found on the SCA website.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Awe can always be paddled, but heavy rain is needed to produce an unscheduled release. Even if the barrage is not releasing, several small tributaries enter the river and the second half of the trip will be more fun if there is some rain or snow melt around. The washed away bridge, just upstream of where the A85 crosses the river, is a good place to check the flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Put in at the Pass of Brander barrage on the A85, halfway between Lochawe and Taynuilt. To reach the take-out at the Inverawe Fisheries and Smokehouse car park, turn right on to the minor road signposted for Inverawe. Alternatively use the jetty at the estuary in the village of Taynuilt where there is ample parking and fantastic views up Loch Etive.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">When the barrage is open a surf wave appears, which makes a convenient place to wait while the shuttle is being run. From here to the road bridge, the river is a series of boulder rapids, the first of which, known as the Graveyard (Gd 3), has a tricky line that beginners may want to inspect. After the bridge, the river enters a gorge with a long grade 2 rapid, ending in a 90 degree bend, which may be interesting in high water. The best rapid of the river, Magnetic Boulder (Gd 3-), comes next. At the bottom of the rapid there<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s a nice playwave at most levels, although it may be shallow when the river is low. A deep pool follows that can be used to collect the pieces. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From here on, the gorge is a series of grade 2 drops and pools until the river opens out onto shingle rapids. The take-out is on the right-hand bank by the suspension bridge. A walk through a cow field brings you to the smokehouse. Alternatively continue for a kilometre to the pier where the river meets Loch Etive. Be aware that 200m after the suspension bridge one of the shingle rapids contains the metal remains of a weir which may be visible at low levels – the river right side has been cleared of debris.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The pool at the put-in, below the barrage on the River Awe, is an important one for fishing interests as it can contain some of the best fishing on the river. The tailrace from the barrage also provides some useful white water<br />and this means there can be several parties all interested in the same piece of water. You can help avoid any problems by speaking to any fishermen who may be present when you first arrive at the river. Often a friendly introduction helps to reduce any tension and gives the angler sufficient time to finish fishing the pool and move downstream before you play at the barrage. Friendly communication can go a long way to ensuring that the needs of both paddlers and anglers are accommodated.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This river runs from Loch Avich into the north side of Loch Awe. The Avich is a wee creek, ideally paddled when conditions are wet, but there’s not a great deal of water elsewhere on the west. The river is quite steep in places and characterised by rocky shallow drops.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Loch Avich serves as a reasonable reservoir at the top of the run and should help to keep the river at a runnable level for up to a day after heavy rain. This run probably requires a similar water level to the nearby River Lochy (Glen Orchy), where there is also a gauge; 7 or 8 is a good level. The run is easily feasible lower and if most of the rocks above the bridge are covered the trip should be a go. At high flows, the low trees in the first half of the run will be a problem. You can get a good view of the main drops by walking up the track (signed <span xml:lang="en-US">‘</span>river road’) on river left.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river is best approached from Taynuilt (by the River Awe). From here join the B845 south taking the first right turn towards Inverinan. The road follows the north shore of Loch Awe and you come to the river where the road takes a sharp right turn to cross the narrow bridge. This is the take-out. There<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s room to park just before the bridge. To reach the put-in, return towards Inverinan taking the first left up towards Loch Avich. You can park by the loch just after the cattle grid.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Put in on the loch, and paddle for about a kilometre along the eastern shore until you reach the river. A wee river, initially flat with a tree slalom, there are only a couple of rocky ledges<br />before you come to the first major event. This consists of four shallow rapids/drops<span xml:lang="en-US">,</span> and is worth a look in case of trees. The one rapid of consequence on the river, definitely worth inspecting, is aptly named Batty Crease (Gd 4+). It’s a narrow triple fall, with a pot-hole on the second drop. At lower levels the pothole was OK, as each one of our boats navigated the bottom, and popped up heading skywards! From here it’s a bit of a rock bash to the take-out, on river left, just before the road bridge crosses the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-1"><a id="Anchor-88" />Orchy</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>Half a mile south of the Bridge of Orchy Hotel, on the A82 between Glasgow and Fort William, is a small signpost proudly proclaiming Glen Orchy. This single-track road, the B8074, leads all the way to the bottom of the glen, where it meets the A85 Tyndrum to Oban road. The open glacier</span><span xml:lang="en-US">-</span><span>carved glen offers superb views both upstream and downstream. Loch Tulla supplies the Orchy with a small reservoir of water</span><span xml:lang="en-US">,</span><span> and consequently the<br />Orchy retains its water longer than any of the neighbouring rivers. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The upper is an easy run that requires high<br />water levels; the classic middle run has the hardest rapids and the lower run has some easy white water but is mainly flat. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Upper Orchy offers the inexperienced a good test of basic skills before moving on to more difficult water. The open nature of this stretch of water, with its shingle rapids, gives easy access to the banks. Combined with<br />eddies in abundance there is never a shortage of places to stop and receive instruction or depart to the waiting vehicle. At very high flows the character changes to a very fast<br />roller coaster run.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Orchy holds its water well and this run is often in condition a couple of days after heavy prolonged rain. Above 2½ on the gauge at Bridge of Orchy is ideal (the gauge that reads up to 13 located on the right-hand side below the bridge). </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Turn off the A82 beside the Bridge of Orchy Hotel, onto the B8005. Cross the river and continue along the right bank until you are at Loch Tulla. It is a short carry to put on at the loch. Egress is back at Bridge of Orchy where there is ample parking.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Starting at Loch Tulla, the Orchy has a series of fine surf waves with lots to keep the novice interested. At the Bridge of Orchy, there is a slightly harder rapid to negotiate.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Middle Orchy has very defined rapids separated by long flat stretches. Most of the falls are produced by harder sections of bedrock, which have resisted erosion.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">With a road running alongside for the upper half of the run, the Orchy is a river where non-paddling partners can watch, and escape can easily be made. Likewise, it makes an ideal group trip since all of the harder rapids can be portaged. For those who prefer to park and play, it is possible to carry up from the new parking area at the bottom of the run, to the potentially feisty playhole above Witches Step – beware in high water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>After prolonged rain the river will retain its water<br />for a day or so. The gauge at Bridge of </span><span>Orchy helps to judge the flow. There are two metal gauges on the downstream right of the bridge</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> –</span><span> use the one that goes up to 13. Between 0 and 1 is low, scrapey between the big rapids; between 1 and 2 is medium, good for a first run down; between 2 and 3 is high; between 3 and 5 will feel very big and Eas a’Chathaidh will likely have the central line running; above 5 the river is in flood, rapids will have merged together and the river will have a continuous feel. The road may well be flooded especially in the lower sections of the glen. Don’t forget that during rain there are many small tributaries swelling the Orchy along its length. </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">About 0.6 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum level for the middle section.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The most regularly used put-in is at the Bridge of Orchy Hotel by the gauge. Another popular access point for more experienced paddlers is where the B8074 first meets the Orchy at the small tributary the Allt Kinglass. There is very limited space for vehicles so please park carefully. For large groups with mini-buses or many cars there is a pull-in 500m upstream of Sheep Trolley Gorge with ample parking. This is the obvious rapid close to the road 1½ miles down the B8074. This also provides an access or egress point for shortened trips. The Forestry<br />Commission have built a new car park at the end of the run (NN 56.4480, -4.8518; NN 243 320) and riverside path which allows you to walk up to the playhole for some park ‘n’ play and to view the final rapids. The funding package for this project included a grant from the Andy Jackson Fund for Access, using proceeds from previous editions of this guidebook.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Putting in at the Allt Kinglass you only have a short float to get your muscles into boating mode before the first rapid, Big Rock. At grade 3+, this is an ideal warm-up for what is to come below. The next rapid, Chicken Shoot (Gd 4), comes after a right-hand bend and in high flows offers good sport. In low water, the left side of the island is somewhat easier (Gd 3). From here there is a long paddle past the<br />occasional interesting playspot before the start of Sheep Trolley Gorge (Gd 3+); the old sheep trolley has long since been removed. The wave at the end of the rapid offers<br />excellent entertainment for flat-hulled boats as well as being a good tail squirt spot. The road is now close to the river all the way to Easan Dubha (essan doo-u), where the river gathers its strength and produces a stiff obstacle (Gd 5-). A run off-line here can go unpunished or end in near drowning! The fall becomes easier with more water, as the middle line becomes a monster wave. However, the consequences of a swim become serious and, unless rapidly ‘bagged’, swimmers may get washed through Saw Tooth (Gd 4) just below. Several people have come out of this experience with scary stories and broken bones.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A small flat section leads to Roller Coaster (Gd 3). Soon after this the river leaves the road. End of Civilisation, by far the best grade 4 and the longest rapid on the river, appears after a left-hand bend. To make the best of this rapid, take a line down the left through the two holes and into the convenient eddy. The second half of the rapid is easier but still demands respect.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Easier water leads to several playwaves and holes, the most inviting of which is only yards from the last eddy before Eas a Chathaidh (ess a’ cha-ay). This is the hardest rapid on the river<br />and deserves its grade 5 reputation. A large island splits the river giving three choices. In very low water the right offers a 3m vertical fall. At higher flows, this rapidly gains a monster towback and recirculates swimmers very nicely. The left side is more often paddled and offers a double drop that ends in a jagged ramp. In high water, a line opens up over the middle of the island – just don’t get swept right! Portaging is simple on the left on a new path part-funded by proceeds from the previous guidebook. The seal launch entry is fun.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Below here an island splits the river, and at medium/high flows, there is a good but feisty playhole on the left side. This hole can recirculate swimmers at high flows. From here, you are soon at Witches Step (Gd 4-). Here the <br />river splits again with most water coming down the left. The brave or off-line will drop into the guts of the slot and reappear several metres downstream vacuum packed. Run close to the island on its left-hand side to avoid this underwater experience.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is an ideal place to end your trip as a short grassy bank leads to the road and Eas Urchaidh (ess oorachay) or the Falls of Orchy lie just downstream. They have been run down the fish ladder (right) in very low water and by the extreme left chute/slab missing the main rapid in medium flows, but the guts of the<br />rapid only really becomes runnable in spate, and then it is still a full-on encounter well worthy of a grade 5 ticket.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To reach the put-in from the A85, drive up the glen on the B8074 until you reach the dramatic<br />Falls of Orchy (NN 242 321). Access to the<br />river is from the right bank below the falls, by the metal road bridge. It is possible to get out above Loch Awe, at Dalmally Bridge on the A85 (NN 165 276). However, the paddle out into the loch is worth the extra effort to visit the now abandoned Castle Kilchurn (NN 132 276), which occupies the spit of land jutting out into Loch Awe’s north-eastern end.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Lower Orchy is a good run for intermediate paddlers as swims are not generally of a serious nature. Putting in just below the Falls of Orchy, the first obstacle is a weir that has a weakness in the middle where at some flows a good surf wave forms. From here down to the river gauge at Catnish, the river is grade 2+. The next 6km are a mixed bag of shingle and braided rapids where the forest comes and goes from the banks. Shortly after a lonely house on the left bank the river picks up, and a section of more continuous water brings you to Dalmally Bridge (NN 165 276). From here to the loch, the river is grade 1, but if you have navigated the rest of the river from Loch Tulla, why not complete the trip?</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">In high water this section has some big waves and a couple of big holes. In spate conditions, it becomes very fast until the last 4km.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Kinglass is a small tributary of the Orchy, just to the south of Bridge of Orchy. Short and steep, the Kinglass is a great bit of fun. It is usually done before running the classic Middle Orchy section – something to do while the shuttle is being run!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This run doesn’t really need an awful lot of water, and would be a serious undertaking in flood. If there’s enough to do the Orchy at medium and above, there should be enough for this. A good guide is to look downstream from the A82 or upstream from the Glen Orchy road and decide if the drops look fun.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">To get to the river, turn off the A82 onto the B8074 just south of Bridge of Orchy. After about 200m you get to a bridge over the Kinglass. This is the take-out. To reach the put-in, walk up the river right bank to the A82 road bridge. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This short section holds a series of three or four falls over bedrock. It can be a bit shallow in places but is well worth doing, particularly as you won’t miss any of the main rapids on the Orchy by putting on here. </p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Lochy is a challenging run that flows alongside the A85 Tyndrum to Oban road, dropping into the Lower Orchy, close to Inverlochy.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">This trip needs only a splash of run-off, and will run the day after rain or showery conditions. Above this level the run would not be a sensible option. A hydroscheme&#160;became op-<br />erational in 2016 and extracts a small amount of water (about 2 cumecs) from the&#160;whole section, discharging it back into the river just before the take-out. As such, the river is still paddleable, but requires slightly more water to&#160;come into condition. The pre-hydro method used to check the level still holds largely true – upstream of the A85 road bridge on the river left there are two metal poles sticking out of the rock. When the water is level with the lower<br />of the two poles the run is at a good level – all the drops will go. Any higher and the run would be very courageous. An alternative way to get a good idea of the level is to park at the Forestry Commission Strone Hill car park, off the A85 between the access and egress points and walk down to the main waterfall </span>(NN 210 272)<span xml:lang="en-US">. </span>If this isn’t for you, perhaps the rest of the river won’t be either.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">The river can now be accessed from the bank downstream from the hydro scheme inlet weir. There is space to park a couple of vehicles next to the gate by the A85, and the river is reached after a short walk down the access track.</span> Take out where the A85 in Inverlochy crosses the river. Park just downstream of the bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a very committing river for established grade 5 paddlers. The river is in a fairly deep and constricted canyon, the hard drops being of the waterfall variety. The trip starts abruptly<br />with a slab leading into a grade 5 drop – a quick break-out is a necessity to inspect this fall. Then follows three other grade 5 classics. A 4m fall on river right, Boof or Die, requires a good boof to clear the sticky hole which has recirculated swimmers for a considerable time. An ugly split fall, Fubar, has been run by the left-hand slot. The highlight of the trip comes next, a 5m fall with a tricky run-in. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Some of the drops are awkward to inspect without a bit of climbing and are very tricky to portage without scrambling and boat lowering. This is a serious trip and should be treated as such. If you are up to it, it’s a brilliant run, a true test piece of the area: not for the weak or claustrophobic. The main fall sometimes goes by the very un-Scottish name of Rhaedr Dru… perhaps it was named by visiting Welsh boaters?</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Running from Ben Lui to the A82 just south of Tyndrum, this is a steep and continuous river, with numerous difficult falls. It can be combined with the A<span xml:lang="en-US">l</span>lt Gleann Auchreoch; paddle the Cononish to the confluence and walk up the river right bank.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river should be at least bank full under the A82 road bridge. If there are no rocks showing and small waves, the run is high. If a few rocks are just showing, the river is runnable but some upper sections may be scrapey. The Cononish runs off quickly but is generally a safe bet if the Lower Falloch is high/very high. You can easily walk up to the ‘double drop’ and judge the level.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving north on the A82 you cross the river 2 miles before reaching Tyndrum<span xml:lang="en-US">. T</span>ake the next left turn-off the A82 towards Dalrigh car-park and left again to the parking area. To reach the put-in, turn right to leave the car park and immediately left to follow the Landrover track up the glen. Continue past some houses, then under a railway bridge and up to where the river flattens out and a forest track comes in from the right.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At the time of writing (2017), the landowner was happy for paddlers to drive up the glen to drop boats off. Cars should not under any circumstances be left upstream of the car park. Information regarding these access arrangements and any changes will be available on a noticeboard in the car park. There is a working gold mine at the top of the glen and security is an issue: cars must not be driven above the access point described or across to the tributary A<span xml:lang="en-US">l</span>lt<span xml:lang="en-US"> </span>Gleann<span xml:lang="en-US"> </span>Auchreoch. A small scale hydro scheme and extension to the gold mining operations are both being considered, which may affect access.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Straightforward grade 3 rapids lead to the first difficult drop (Gd 4+), marked by a split in the river around a small island, a fence and a stream entering from the right. Several people have experienced nasty swims in the depths of this fall and the right-hand wall below the fall is undercut! Inspect/portage on river left. A festival of fast twisty slides and ledge drops follow (Gd 4). Take extreme care as there is a hidden siphon lurking on the left side of a 1m fall. This very dangerous feature is far from obvious. Run a 3m waterfall (Gd 4) on river right into beautiful pool and exit right into a gorge. The wall straight across from the waterfall’s right-hand side is slightly undercut and seems to have magnetic properties. There are further grade 3/4 rapids down to the railway bridge, beyond which are further grade 3+ rapids ending in a double drop with multiple channels that all go at different water levels (Gd 4). One more tricky-rapid (Gd 3) follows before reaching the old bridge just upstream of the A82. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">In high water, the river is very continuous. A swim will most likely be unpleasant and your boat may well end up in the River Fillan on the way to Crianlarich.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allt Gleann Auchreoch is a hidden gem located only a couple of miles from Tyndrum. It has the same gradient as the popular Etive tributary, the Allt a’ Chaorainn (75m/km in the upper section) yet it is seldom run. At lower flows, this very steep run has a continuous series of pool-drop rapids. With more water, there is very little room for error as the pools flush out, and the whole run would become serious grade 5/5+.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This run requires a good amount of rain and there needs to be a good flow pouring into the Cononish at the confluence. It’s worth noting that the Allt Gleann Auchreoch may be runnable even if the Cononish is low, as the levels between the two can differ quite considerably. Catch the two together for a great day-out on the water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Access can be made in two ways; by parking at the take-out of the Cononish, walking across the bridge and up the track to the right, or by paddling the Cononish and walking up from the confluence – the track isn’t far away on river<br />right&#160;and although it’s a bit of a battle with vegetation to get up to it, it’ll save you a kilometre of walking compared to hiking up from the take-out. Egress will be as for the Cononish.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description&#160;</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The interesting part of the river starts at the end of the track up the valley, once the track reaches a fence. This is the signal to head down to river level. The river begins with a nice entry into a 3m grade 4+ waterfall. It twists left immediately below, before leading into a double drop, each of about 1–2m. Two further falls of 4m and 1m follow. After the smaller drop, there is a last chance eddy before a section of slightly rockier drops. There is a pool just below the drops to get back in if you decide to portage. The river then narrows for a short section leading into a small slot drop, which is best taken with speed. This is quickly followed by a 1m ledge drop into a slide and 2m drop. The steep section finishes with one last slide before 500m of grade 3. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river increases in difficulty again as you enter the forest and into the lower gorge. There are obvious horizon lines above the 3 major drops. The first being a 1m ledge drop into a slide (Gd 4). The next, a clean 3m drop, is shortly followed by a 5m slide, which is worth inspecting and runs hard right (Gd 5). The last 500m of grade 3+ leads out of a beautiful but tight walled gorge and then to the confluence with the Cononish. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river is not run very often so it is always worth checking for tree blockages.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Allt Auchtertyre, or WigWam Burn, flows into the village of Auchtertyre between Tyndrum and Crianlarich. If you can catch it at the right level (high but not mental) then it’s a great accompaniment to the Cononish, which flows on the opposite side of the valley. Aside from two bigger drops, it’s got some really classy grade 3/4 boating.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Most of the river can take a lot of water before it gets out of order, but be aware of the location of two bigger drops and make sure you can make the eddies. Looking over the bridge, the rock beneath the downstream side should be completely covered and forming a reasonably chunky hole. If you don’t think you can run this rapid then maybe the rest of the river won’t be for you.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Coming from the south on the A82 take the right-hand turn immediately after the bridge over the Cononish (sign-posted for the wigwams) and follow the track to a parking area just before the burn. Walk up the track which follows river right. It’s probably a good idea to stop at the top of the first hill and bash your way to the river to check out a big fall, Spit Roaster. Carry on walking until you reach a stile above the point at which the river splits. The bigger river, on river left, has got some cool slabby stuff to be explored and is more worth-it than it might look. Otherwise put in at the confluence (or slightly below depending on your desire to be ‘Destroyed’).</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Destroyer is first up – a grinding, churning<br />hole immediately after the meeting of the two streams. Below this, 100m or so of good grade 4 boofs lead to an obvious horizon line which can be inspected on river right. The Lamb Fondler (Gd 5) seems to go nicely at most reasonable flows. Decide your own line, but it’s pretty obvious that you don’t want to go left on the bottom flume. The short gorge that follows may have trees to avoid and a good face shot from a side waterfall if the river is high. After this there’s a kilometre of awesome grade 3/4 which all goes sweetly. The river flows through a gentle-sided gorge which makes for easy scouting and portaging if necessary. There’s a great drop and hole under the railway bridge then a 2/3 section until the Spit Roaster breakout which you hopefully scouted on the way up. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Spit Roaster is big and gnarly and may require a portage although it has been run (not tremendously successfully) at a good flow. If it’s very low, then this drop may be an excellent park and huck. The bit from the big drop downwards is a grade 3/4 boulder affair until you reach a challenging wee rapid under the bridge. Run it then take out river right and be careful not to damage the fence.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The top part of the Falloch is a remote and excellent small burn. It consists of long, continuous slab/slide rapids with occasional small falls. It’s narrow, has few eddies and is very steep, making this a hard and serious run but never desperate, unless very high.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If the SEPA gauge is above 1.5 it is worth considering this run. If the river is paddleable at the put-in for the Upper Falloch, or the Lower Falloch at the Seven Dwarves rapid is huge and/or unrunnable, it is well worth the effort.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Park in the large lay-by just south of Crianlarich. Walk across the field, under the railway line, and straight up the Falloch, at 90˚ to the road. After a kilometre a branch is reached in the path. Follow this (left) to the river and a small bridge, walk upstream as far as you fancy! Inspect the take-out above the last drop (the water is fast and continuous here). This drop has been run but does not look very nice either with or without water!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There are several notable rapids. A long, steep boulder rapid leads down to the bridge. After the bridge there is a long right-trending shallow slab, soon followed by a set of slides down to a fence over/in the river – there is a single wire and a fence post in the middle of the ‘pool’ above a small 1.5m fall. There is now a good-sized pool to collect yourself. Another fall, around a boulder, leads to an easier section down to a right bend, and trees. Get out above the bend and trees, and not too late to inspect the last fall from river right.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At super high flows this section could be very serious. Inspect the <span xml:lang="en-US">entire </span>river on the walk-up and be careful. Paul Currant described this section in flood as ‘one of the scariest day’s boating I’ve had in Scotland.’ Proceed with caution!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Falloch runs parallel to the A82 at the northern end of Loch Lomond. The upper stretch starts some 2 miles west of Crianlarich. Perhaps not as classy as the Lower Falloch, this is still a good trip with some excellent white water. The river runs through short gorges lined with the remnants of the Caledonian pine forest, making you feel a lot further from the A82 than you actually are.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Try this one when the Lower Falloch looks a little on the high side. The river will want to be full and definitely running high and looking scary when viewed from the A82 road bridge on the lower run (see the description for the Lower Falloch). A reading of 1.0 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Driving north on the A82, you will find the put-in for the Upper Falloch about 2 miles before Crianlarich. The river can be seen emerging from the forest and mountains before making a left turn to run alongside the A82. At a straight in the road there<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s a large lay-by offering ample parking. Cross under the railway and put in at the left-hand bend. Take out some 3 miles downstream by the wooden bridge at Derrydarroch Farm. You can continue to the Falls of Falloch car park, but the section is flat/interspersed with awkward drops.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At high flows this run is fairly shifting, so although the water is easy enough to start off with, you need to take care not to get swept into anything unpleasant. A large slab into a narrow slot marks the start of the white water<br />proper. This is a grade 5 and probably fairly dangerous at very high flows. A long grade 4 section, which is the sweetest part of the river,<br />lies upstream of the bridge at Derrydaroch<br />Farm. From here to the Falls of Falloch is a mixture of easier water and one or two nasty drops that are probably worth a portage. If you don’t intend to run the falls, consider getting out at the farm as it’s an awkward walk from above the falls back to the car park.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Falloch runs parallel to the A82 at the northern end of Loch Lomond. The Lower Falloch is the 3km run starting with the Falls of Falloch. It<span xml:lang="en-US">’</span>s a beautiful run that combines a large photogenic waterfall with a long technical gorge. At good water levels, the river is difficult and serious, but never desperate<span xml:lang="en-US">. This is</span> one of Scotland’s classic rivers.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At high flows, this run will be very serious, but some rain is required. If the fall seen from the road is just runnable, then the river is possible. The best indicator is to look over the second (most northerly) road bridge, and decide if you like the look of the rapid below. 0.8 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Park at the Falls of Falloch car park and walk upstream for 200m. Get in above or below the waterfall. Take out below the fall that can be seen from the road, upstream of Glen Falloch farm. Parking is limited here, so please be considerate and walk the shuttle if necessary.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The 10m waterfall at the put-in is run on a fairly<br />regular basis, but is high enough to do some serious damage if you get it wrong. Watch out for the tricky stopper on the lip! For a more mellow start to the trip, seal launch into the pool below the fall, and take some time out to enjoy the scenery. From this point, straight-<br />forward rapids lead to a sharp right-hand bend and the first grade 4 fall. The river eases off, then drops over several chutes and increases once more to grade 4. A left turn and looming walls herald the start of the gorge and the Seven<br />Dwarves, best inspected on the left. All the drops are runnable but protection is recommended, especially for The Black Hole, a small drop into a very sticky hole which lurks under the A82 bridge. Flat water leads back under the A82 to a large fall, Twist and Shout, which can be inspected from the huge central rock. It is run left, but there is a chicken chute/fish ladder on the right. The last fall, visible from the road, has rocks at the base of the main line and is best run over the slabs on the left-hand side.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">At high flows, these rapids will become very serious, and you may wish to consider running the top section down to the fall.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A highly entertaining river with some good grade 5 action, the main attractions are three sets of falls, which provide a good technical challenge. Even if these are portaged, the river is still a fun trip for the intermediate paddler.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Aray needs quite a lot of rain to be runnable and tends to run off quickly despite its size. However, take note that the harder rapids get increasingly serious at higher flows. It’s best to judge the flow by locating any of the major falls described below. This should allow you to decide if the trip is on, as well as noting those must-make eddies. If you can easily float between the falls the trip will be fun. A good high flow is best but beware that at super high flows it would be easy to get swept into the falls, which look hideous when high.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Drive north on the A819 from Inveraray. After 4½ miles, there is a braided section of the river that is alongside the road. Get in here or further upstream if you enjoy dodging low trees! The take-out is very pleasant; keep going to the sea and finish at the Inveraray harbour front.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The first part of the run is easy cruising. However, this ends abruptly after about 1½km at the Falls of Aray, marked by a wire bridge. Don’t miss the eddy; inspection or a portage will be required here. The right-hand side is a beautiful staircase fall. The river eases up for a while until Three Bridges (Gd 5) after a kilometre or so. This is a hard rapid with some ugly bedrock. A sneak route exists on river right. The final grade 5 rapid,<br />Carloonan Mill Falls</span><span xml:lang="en-US">,</span><span> can be taken by a double drop on the right or a narrow high slot on river<br />left. From here to the sea the river features some weir-type drops with the occasional nice surf wave until you hit the salt in Loch Fyne.</span></p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The&#160;Douglas&#160;lies to the south-west of Inveraray on the A83. The river is an adventure containing numerous rapids, drops and fast slides, the highlight perhaps being an intimidating 9m plunge into a large pool.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Look upstream of the A83 road bridge. There are two ledges on the bridge pillar (river right) with a gauge right next to the bridge. If the water<br />level is just on the top step (about 6 on the gauge) then the run will be at a low medium. If the gauge is above 9 the run becomes more serious with some rapids running into one<br />another meaning mistakes will be punished.<a id="x.48196" /></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The cloud of the hydro scheme has a silver lining in that a good quality dirt track has been built up the river to a convenient put-in next to the hydro in-take. To reach the track, drive approximately one mile west from the A83 road bridge where it turns right towards the river (NN 044 042; 56.19, -5.153). Follow this track for about 3 miles up to the point at which it crosses the river next to the hydro in-take (NN 040 076). </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Immediately after the hydro in-take is an old bridge with a rocky 3m drop just below. Easy water for 500m leads to Crash and Burne, two 5m falls in quick succession.&#160;Inspection or portage is possible on the right. The first drop goes nicely, but you should take particular care on the second of the pair as it was the scene of a nasty pinning accident caused by rocks at the base of the fall. A fast slide is soon followed by more bedrock rapids, the last of which is a tricky 7m fall into a large pool. After a twisting river-wide ledge, stay on your toes as the impressive 9m drop tempts you in from above with an easier rapid. A last-gasp eddy presents itself on river left if you miss the horizon from above. A few more harder rapids in a deep gorge follow, the end of which are signalled by a 2m weir. From here boogie-on down past the hydro outlet to the A83 bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">There is another 1.5km of river which drops a further 35m on its way down to Loch Fyne. If you’ve not had enough by now this might be worth a look? There’s an easy roadside take-out near the caravan park, and additional water<br />from the hydro inlet to keep things flowing. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent para-style-override-6">‘Crash and Burne’ </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span class="Pesda-Italics" xml:lang="en-US">Whilst spending a weekend exploring and in search of some lesser run white water, the brutal sounding ‘5km walk-in’ to the Douglas Water piqued our interest. It sounded unlikely many would have ventured up there, but the river sounded worth it. The first significant rapid comprised two chunky drops separated by a short pool. A round of boofs and smiles later and we were half-way done. That’s where the day began to come undone – for me at least. Rob probed first, boofing smoothly right followed by an inelegant bounce down the rocky slab. Feeling on form, I fancied something smoother, perhaps a bit burlier, so opted for the centre line. In retrospect this wasn’t so smooth after all! A kicker of water was made, not by the convergence of two flows of water, but by a small rock.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span class="Pesda-Italics" xml:lang="en-US">It’s an easy line. Drift in, line up, melt and tuck. Everything goes black. The next thing I remember? A thunderous white-out world of water covering all but a pocket of air in front of my face – thankfully allowing me to breathe. I had hit the rock, been shunted forward in my boat, hit the cockpit with my head and am now pinned underwater, hazily assessing my predica-<br />ment. The force of the water on my back is flattening me against my deck – too strong to push myself back into a more neutral position. I manage to wiggle my left leg free, but the right will not budge – it is now the only thing preventing my exit. I hesitantly lift myself into the flow to see what happens, but watch as my knee starts to bend unnaturally the wrong way.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span class="Pesda-Italics" xml:lang="en-US">Abort plan. I wiggle some more but only seem to sink further into the kayak. The force of the water rips off my elbow pads, then my helmet. With the helmet floating off downstream the pocket I had for breathing starts to close; I begin to inhale water. “B%!!%cks ...” Back to the plan. Act now, deal with the damage later. I push upwards into the powerful flow and watch as my leg folds 90° the wrong way at my knee, I am caught hanging there for a tense few seconds, then my boat un-pins and my leg is released. I make for the bank. It takes a few seconds for me to realise my lower leg is flopping round like a feeble semi.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span class="Pesda-Italics" xml:lang="en-US">Three minutes underwater, two and a half of them unconscious, lost helmet, dignity and ruined ligaments. Entry into the magic knees club complete; and the rapid Crash and Burne gets its name! After four operations and six months of crutches/wheelchair I am back up and just about running again. New ligaments, new limitations, new appreciation of life. I’ve still not been back to the Douglas Water – but I will! From what I’m told (and the photos my team took when they finished the run) it’s a truly spectacular river!’ </span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Dave Burne would like to thank big brother Tim, Rob Tuley, Martin Linford and Beth Hume for the rescue and evacuation, and apologise for putting them through a stressful start to the day! A big up goes out to the Mountain Rescue and the Royal Navy Search and Rescue Helicopter Crew.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This small spate river offers tight technical canoeing in splendid wild country. The first kilometre from Inverchorachan in particular is superb. The road that runs beside the Fyne is privately owned and you will need to walk up.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The lower sections should look ‘floatable’.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A private road branches off the A83 at the northern end of Loch Fyne and leads to the glen. Vehicles are not permitted and walking is required. The hardest and best of the Fyne is above Glenfyne Lodge. If you can make it, put in near a lone white cottage at a flattening called Inverchorachan. Take out at Glenfyne Lodge (NN 214 148; 56.2919, -4.8874) or carry on to Loch Fyne, where the A83 crosses the river’s estuary.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The opening triple Granite Falls (Gd 5) are technical and spectacular with the 15m deep ‘black hole’ waiting with open arms below the middle fall. A short way below Granite Falls is the difficult and serious shallow ramped Salmon Ladder (Gd 5) with boulders blocking the exit. After<br />the confluence with the Allt na Lairige, the Fyne has fairly continuous grade 3 white water<br />down to the bridge below Glenfyne Lodge. From here it is 5km of flat water to the sea.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Before the first edition of this book in 2001, Terry Storry’s seminal guidebook <span class="Pesda-Citation" xml:lang="en-US">British White Water: The 100 Best Canoeing Rivers</span> was well used by paddlers exploring Scotland. A guide to the Fyne&#160;was one of those that appeared in this influential book and&#160;is included in&#160;Scottish White Water in memory of and in tribute<br />to Terry Storry, who was one of the many who started the ball rolling. He sadly died in a climbing accident in 2004.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Kinglas follows an open, steep-sided glen from just below the ‘Rest and Be Thankful’ pass to Loch Fyne. It’s a steep and continuous alpine-<br />style river, which rises and falls quickly, but is more than worth the effort. At high flows, it becomes very serious in the middle section.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This is a run to do while it’s still raining, or has only just stopped. Heavy localised rain the night before is a good sign. A new hydro scheme has been built on the upper half of this run. The new intake weir is at a series of slabs where the river steepens and should be portaged. The amount of water taken by the scheme (1<span xml:lang="en-US"> </span>cumec) is relatively small and the impact on the section of river is small. There are rock slabs under Butterbridge, the old stone road bridge at the top of the glen. If these are covered, the river is runnable. If the water level is up to or over the banks, the top section will be serious, and the gorge harder still.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Put on at Butterbridge, found on the A83 from Tarbet to Inveraray, 2 miles upstream from the junction with the A815. Take out where the A83 meets Loch Fyne and the Cairndow village road. There is a convenient bus shelter here in which to await the shuttle. Alternatively a warm drink can be had at the hotel in Cairndow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>The first half of the river is continuous white water, gradually increasing in grade with at least three steeper sections that deserve bank scouting. It becomes harder in high water. The river parts around an island on the approach to the hydro scheme. Portage left. The river passes through a narrow slot under a wooden plank and the rapid below is slightly undercut on the left at the bottom. Below this, at the point where the forest meets the river, marks a hard and potentially dangerous drop (Gd 5). After this, the run becomes more continuous, and perhaps a grade harder than in the upper section. The river passes several notable technical drops including a fall with a potholed slot on the left/slab on the right. It now approaches an old footbridge and below this, a long narrow gorge ending in the Headchopper, an </span><span xml:lang="en-US">undercut drop with retentive hole at some flows</span><span>. The tunnel is next</span><span xml:lang="en-US">;</span><span> take care as trees have been seen here, followed by a long rapid in a narrow gorge. The final weir should be run centre left.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Watch out for trees, which fall into the river with reasonable frequency. Care should be<br />taken, especially in the gorge, tunnel and<br />lower sections. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Less than 100m downstream of&#160;the&#160;hydro scheme are two boulders with a&#160;rudimentary<br />bridge, a plank of wood and wire that sits somewhere between water level and around 1.5m above, depending on the height of the river. Until you know the river well, it is advisable to scout downstream from the hydro to locate this potential hazard. The grade 5 rapid is about 200m below this.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Please do not drive down the private road on river left of the lower section. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If the river is very high consider walking upstream from Butterbridge as far as you can carry. Beware of fences under bridges. The river<br />is generally easier at the upper end of the glen (Gd 3/4+), getting gradually harder as it<br />approaches the normal Kinglas section.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Cur is a spate run in a remote glen.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Cur runs at similar levels to the Kinglas. Although it can be running OK when the Kinglas is a bit scrapy, it also deals well with high levels (say, if you’ve run away from the Kinglas as it’s a little too high). You should be able to get a good idea of the level from the small bridge at Strachurmore, and decide whether it is worth continuing up the glen.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">You can drive as far as the confluence with the Leavanin, where there is space to leave a car. Then you must shoulder your boat for the hike upstream. A kilometre brings you to a notable confluence (NN 130 024), which is a sensible put-in if levels are relatively low. Alternatively, continue further upstream on either fork and explore. If you’re rushed for time, a small bridge at Strachurmore (NN 107 008) marks the end of the white water, but the grade 2 cruise down to Glenbranter is a pleasant enough way to extend the trip.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><span>If the river is high, you can continue further up the river left fork. This gives an open grade 4 rapid leading to a narrowing of the river and a fast-flowing braided section before the confluence. Look out for a fence under the bridge. After the confluence, you soon enter the short gorge above Succoth Farm. This contains the most significant rapid of the run, a ledge drop, which can have a grabby hole in high water. The gorge section for the 1.5km above&#160;Strachurmore&#160;has several fun&#160;sections of grade 4 but is fast flowing and in a forest, so beware of strainers. The majority of the gradient is spent by this point, leaving a pleasant grade 2 float (trees permitting) to the take</span><span xml:lang="en-US">-</span><span>out at Glenbranter.</span></p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">An unusual but entertaining one hit wonder (NS 106 967) on the <span class="Pesda-Bold--Emphasis-">Allt Robuic</span> is not far from the take-out. The burn passes through a tunnel under an embankment. With enough water, you’re fired 15m through a 1.5m diameter tube before emerging into the light and launched off the lip of a 3m drop. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If you’ve got bikes with you and fancy some multisport, there’s a nice single-track MTB loop at Glenbranter!</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The put-in is just upstream of the Clachaig where a small farm track leads down towards the river. Park in the lay-by opposite the junction and walk your boat 100m down to the river.<br />Alternatively, there are a number of potential put-ins a little further upstream where the road is close to the river. Take-out at the A815 road bridge where some convenient gates upstream of the bridge on river left bring you up to the road.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Some fairly sustained rain is needed to bring this run into condition. The nearby and better known Kinglas should be at a sporting level. If you can get around the first corner without scraping gravel, there should be enough water to make the run worthwhile. If it is brown and flowing fast here proceed with caution!</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Shortly after launching, a small weir with a surprisingly grabby hole indicates the start of the gorge. Soon after, the river constricts and squeezes through Gunpowder Gorge, an ugly technical twisting series of falls (Gd 5). The portage, if required, is probably easier on the left through the ruins of the old gunpowder mill. Fun read and run follows until a double step grade 4 rapid under the road bridge in the middle of the run – easy to check out on your drive upstream! The majority of the gradient is spent by this point, with one short section of grade 3/4 before the run eases for a pleasant meander-<br />ing cruise to the take-out at the road bridge.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Douglas flows into the west side of Loch Lomond, to the north of Glen Luss. The river starts off flat before dropping into a wooded valley. The rapids are plentiful and inspection easy. The Falls of Douglas, which mark the end of the run, are an impressive yet serious piece of water.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">If the river below the A82 road bridge looks just runnable, then this river is worth doing<span xml:lang="en-US">;</span> if it is high and in flood, take care. If the gauge at the put<span xml:lang="en-US">-</span>in shows 470, it is low but runnable. On the downstream side of the take-out bridge, if the midstream rock is just covered, the run is low.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Turn off the A82 onto the Glen Douglas road. Almost immediately you will reach a small area next to a bridge crossing the Douglas. You can park your car here and walk upstream for a couple of minutes to see the Falls of Douglas. This is the take-out. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The put-in is about 1½ miles upstream at a lay-by where there is a track down to the weir. There are alternate access points further up the glen, but be aware of the MOD land. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The mini-gorge immediately below the weir is technically the hardest section (except for the falls) and is worth scouting from the left bank. Beyond, as the river drops into the gorge, the fun continues, with many short grade 3/4<br />rapids. These are all easily inspected, often from the last eddy above them. Fallen trees are a potential hazard making inspection worthwhile. One narrow grade 4 about a kilometre into the run is particularly prone to tree blockages and is usually inspected from the right. Grade 3 water continues until a longer rapid is encountered. This consists of some 100m of grade 3+ water, ending in a nice slab slide after a left turn. From here, a few straightforward rapids<br />take you down to the egress, immediately above the Falls of Douglas. Don’t miss the eddy! The falls have been paddled, but not at a level where the rest of the river would go. A short walk is required to get back to the car park by the bridge. Take care as the return path is often slippery with a steep drop down to the river.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The description given is for medium levels. In high water, this river has a fast alpine feel to it. New surf waves appear, new lines are possible and eddies are fewer, an incredible run. It is strongly advised to inspect the last eddy above the <span xml:lang="en-US">f</span>alls before paddling the river. At certain levels, this eddy is small, and the lead in to the <span xml:lang="en-US">f</span>alls is not obvious from the river.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Luss flows from the west into the bottom end of Loch Lomond. This is a small river in a deep wooded glen. It has many paddleable<br />rapids, but take care to miss out the Falls of Luss.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river needs plenty of water, but is a serious undertaking at very high flows. Most of the rocks below the A82 road bridge should be covered. 0.5 on the SEPA gauge should be considered a minimum flow.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Turn off the A82 and drive to the top of Glen Luss. Put in on the Mollochan Burn, which should look small but runnable. Parking is limited here – there is alternative parking down the glen below Glenmollochan Farm. The take-out is below the old road bridge, in Luss village, where there is a large car park.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Most of the rapids are runnable at grade 4. Watch out for the 3m, two-tier fall on the Mollochan Burn, which appears some 200m from the start. The harder rapids (Gd 4+) on the main river are in the first kilometre. After 1.5km the river drops into a nasty tree choked gorge, The Falls of Luss, which can be portaged either side. The river then eases slightly on the way down to the village of Luss.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This run is similar in style to the neighbouring Douglas Water and can be choked with trees in places. The Upper Luss, above the section described, has a few grade 4 drops, interspersed with flat water, but would require a walk-in. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Further south, the<span class="Pesda-Bold--Emphasis-"> </span><span class="Pesda-Bold--Emphasis-">Fruin Water</span>, South Western Loch Lomond (NS 320 846; 56.0247, -4.6972) has been run giving a section of grade 4 white water with significant tree hazard. It needs a lot of water.</p>
