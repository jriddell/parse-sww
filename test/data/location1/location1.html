			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">After many years of hard work, driven by Andy Watt, Scotland now has an artificial white<br />water course right in Glasgow city centre with easy access from the M8. Water is filtered to keep it clean and the closed basin means the water temperature is typically a couple of degrees warmer than the surrounding rivers. Compared to natural rivers the course runs tight with strong eddies even on one or two pumps, which surprises many beginners. The best hole for playboating is before the first corner but make sure it’s on three pumps when trying loops if you value your head. Several waves down the course provide places to practice surfing as well as sections to practice ferry gliding and breaking in/out. As of 2017 the short course is still being worked on to create a perfect playhole.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent"><a id="x.21470" />There are slalom gates, polo pitches, classrooms and even space for racing practice. The shallow water area is useful for coaching rolls. There is also plenty of parking onsite as well as disabled facilities.</p>
