			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Helmsdale, a major salmon-fishing river, flows from Loch Badanloch in central Sutherland to the east coast at Helmsdale. The river winds its way through the Strath of Kildonan, scene of one of the most notorious of the Highland Clearances and also famous for its gold rush in the 1870s. It is still possible to get a permit, hire a gold pan and take your chance of finding a nugget in the Kildonan Burn at Baile an Òr (NC 912 214) if there is insufficient water for canoeing. For most of its length the river is featureless, but for a couple of miles near Kildonan Station it offers quite challenging boating.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river can be paddled at a range of levels and is regulated by the outflow from the weir at Badanloch. At higher levels, the section above and below the bridge at Kildonan Station becomes more powerful. The main white-water sections require a level of at least 0.9 on the SEPA gauge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river can be inspected from the A897 at Kildonan and can be accessed from the road about 1km above Upper Suisgill, where a small cottage can be seen on the far side of the river. It’s possible to take out by Kildonan Station where vehicles can be left at the old school yard. However, to catch the last main rapid, take out anywhere along the next section beyond the farmhouse where the river meanders close to the road.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the put-in, around 1km of grade 2 water leads to a footbridge and a series of grade 3 steps. As the river moves away from the road, there is a series of narrow rocky channels and small drops. Just upstream of Kildonan Station, the river takes a turn to the left and is split by a central rock. The left-hand channel is blocked by rocks, while the right takes you through a pour-over; this grade 4 rapid warrants inspection. At low/medium levels an undercut on the right-hand side of the boulder can become a hazard. The small vicious eddy that forms to the right of the slot has a tendency to slow you down enough to feed you back into the stopper and thus the undercut. Next, a long pleasant grade 3+ on river right leads down to the bridge by the station and the upper take-out. A series of grade 2/3 ledges leads, after 500m, to a two-tier drop (Gd 4+).<br />There is pinning potential at low/medium<br />water levels as the bottom of the second slot is shallow and an undercut ridge of bedrock runs parallel to the run-off from the slot. After this, the river levels out and continues at grade 2-. There is little to interest the white-water boater downstream, but for touring paddlers the river continues in a broad open strath in a series of meanders for a further 10km to the sea. There is a big concrete weir on this section that can be seen in the distance from the road, which may not be runnable.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Kilphedir Burn is a small, steep tributary of the River Helmsdale. It is a short run of small drops and big rock slides.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">This run is at its best following heavy rain and drops off very quickly. If there is no bedrock showing in the rock slide under the road bridge (NC 989 187), the burn may be too high! In high water, this run would be continuous grade 5+ and most mortals, excepting the intellectually challenged, would probably decide to leave it for another day.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the south take a left-hand turn onto the A897 in Helmsdale signposted for Melvich. Follow the single-track road for about 4 miles, until some sheep pens are passed on the left-hand side. Kilphedir Burn flows under a small arched road bridge with a gravel car park immediately to the right. The short steep gorge can be inspected during the walk-in on river right. The put-in is above a 3m rock slide that is reached after about 20–30 minutes walking. Above this point the burn appears to flatten out. Take out after the large rock slide under the road bridge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The run is made up of vertical drops of approximately 2–3m and rock slides with small pools in between. Trees on both sides of the burn may become potential hazards at certain levels.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">I have witnessed the burn in full spate and it is a fearful sight! If, however, the burn is in good condition, why not climb back up to the top for another adrenaline fix! If it is too high to run, the Helmsdale may be a good alternative.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Berriedale Water is the main river draining the flow country of central Caithness and the hills of Morven, Maiden Pap and Scaraben. The river reaches the sea through a deeply incised valley at the notorious Berriedale Braes. This river is a long paddle through a remote and spectacular Highland glen. Sadly, estate staff have been very ‘anti’ in the past.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river is only runnable during or after considerable rain or snow melt. The level can be checked at the A9 road bridge at the bottom of the braes. A reading of around 2 feet 3 inches on the gauge on the upstream bridge abutment will give an excellent trip.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The take-out is at the A9 road bridge, but an 11 mile detour is necessary to get to the put-in. From the A9 at Dunbeath it is necessary to take the minor road to Braemore. The put-in is at the bridge by the phone box at the end of this road.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">From the put-in the river is grade 2. Watch out for a deer fence after about 1km. The river then enters the glen and becomes narrower with continuous grade 2. Another 2km leads to a small gorge with a footbridge above it. This hides a grade 3 drop over a 2m fall, followed by a couple of tricky rapids. The valley sides become more imposing as the river continues at grade 2 and 3 down the glen. A gradual narrowing leads to a grade 5 section; a tricky run-in is followed by two 3m ledge drops, then a powerful river-<br />wide stopper. This section can be inspected/portaged via a path on river right, which leads to a vantage point on a metal footbridge high above the gorge. Care should be taken to get off the river well above this rapid as although the entry to it is a long straight section of fast grade 1 water, there are no significant eddies and therefore a danger of getting swept down the rapid if you leave it too late.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A further series of grade 2 drops, and a low-level bridge which could be hazardous at high flows, lead after a water gate to the narrower tree-lined continuous grade 3 section. Take out by the twin bridges at the A9, or<br />alternatively at the harbour, which will mean a short carry back up to the road.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Under the A9 road bridge there is a confluence with <span class="Pesda-Bold--Emphasis-">Langwell Water</span>. The lower part looks very good, but you would need access up the locked private estate road to get on the river. Estate staff have declined access in the past.</p>
