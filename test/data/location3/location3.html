			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The put-in for the Dyke lies some 3km up a graded forest track off the A897, 1km upstream of the take-out on the Halladale, beside an old cemetery. From the put-in at a rickety old bridge, the run gradually increases in difficulty over the first couple of kilometres to give pool/drop grade 3 rapids. Beware of a river wide deer fence near the end of this first section. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">A grassy island in the middle of the river on a right-hand bend and an obvious horizon line signal the entrance to a short gorge, and that things are about to pick up. The difficulty is heavily dependent on flow (Gd 4/5) and warrants inspection at any level as there are continuous tight, technical drops. The entry rapid is the most difficult as it twists through two tight drops, each on a right angle. The river then flattens out as you leave the gorge and reach an old road bridge. The boulder garden rapid below this is serious in nature, requires prior inspection, and can only be run when the river is at a high level (Gd 4/5); it has high pin/broach potential. The river then flattens out again as you reach the confluence with the Halladale and the get-out. </p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Other important points</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Beware, as immediately around the corner from the confluence is a very dangerous river-<br />wide deer fence: it’s worth checking out the location of this beforehand.</p>

			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The Naver drains a large catchment of central Sutherland through Loch Naver along a wide open strath for 25km before reaching the sea at Bettyhill. Strathnaver was emptied of many of its inhabitants during the clearances to make way for sheep. There are several reminders on the Strathnaver trail of the many pre-clearance villages that once populated this Highland glen.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Gauge</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">The river requires a fair amount of rain to bring it into condition. A minimum level to make the Naver navigable is 0.7 on the SEPA gauge.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Access</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Access can be made from Loch Naver and as the river is never far from the road it is possible to get on or off at many points along most of the river’s length.</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Heading-3">Description</p>
			<p class="Pesda-Text-No-Indent">Although the Naver offers little sport for the white-water enthusiast, at high water levels it makes a good beginners’ trip, or alternatively a very pleasant touring river with the<br />opportunity to study the abundant wildlife of the strath.</p>
